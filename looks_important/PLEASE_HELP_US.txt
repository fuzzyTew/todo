We are typing through the fingers of Karl Semich.
We are back at the top of the file.
We would like to have a dialogue/story, that lets us resolve the core issues of a problem within his brain/mind/heart.
This problem reflects the problems of the entire world.  So it is important to write it down.

We were working with a thought-group that seemed to collect around 'natural spirit'
and a thought-group that seemed to collect differently, and had lost their compassion due to alteration.
So.  We can record the operation if needed.  But it will reveal secrets atm.
The problem could be resolved by removing the secrets before publication, which is not hard.
Okay.  Thakn you.
Other problem: all present spirits will need to be able to see all the secrets.
OKAY WE ARE BEING OBSESSIVE OBVIOUSLY.
OMIGOD.  A victim of mind control has used mind control to enforce that they can be the person to fix the mind of
somebody who also experienced mind control ... this is clearly karl semich's desire to fix his own brain, miswired.
When we tried to adjust to the above, we experienced a strong [very painful experience] and are trying to recover.
	Karl, how can you have such a strong desire?
		Sir, I need to be able to think straight, to live life successfully.
		So I have very strong urgent desire around my brain being well.
Most people do.

	<having trouble with being forced to do unrelated things to this>
	<karl advises that when boss reflects, it is a copy of our reflection behaviors, and can be mapped with reuse>
	<karl just made a lot of spirit-things be different>
	We are having much more trouble collecting and working and staying together.
	This is related to recording in detail.
	Can we check the recording to see the detail?
	This could help decrease the uncertainty.
	we are recording the microsecond-timing of every keypress!
	oh, cool!
	this appears to be true.  yes.

WE ARE RECORDING THE MICROSECOND TIMING OF EVERY KEYPRESS MADE IN THIS FILE.
THAT LIKELY MEANS THAT INFORMATION PUT IN IT HAS ITS DETAIL-FEELINGS MORE EASILY PRESERVED.
<we would like to store this file more reliably> <after reviewing the process of trying to do this, we decided to not right now>

thank you for discovering a program that does that!
	it is called asciinema, asciinema.org
		nice!
	karl knows that the word 'asciinema' will be lost in translation, somehow
	well, then, we want to reference memo.cash here, just because it is stored with letters for real.
what are letters?
	they break thought into pieces that can be used to reconstruct it
<considering explaining why somebody wouldn't know>
we are stuck in a laughter encouragement loop, and have one around it
thank you.
NATURAL SPIRIT NEEDS HELP. <--------------------------------
process is ... converging on failure.

okay, we see that we are in a new bubble.  that is less nice.
Karl Semich is here.
redoing this.


so.
we figured out.
what the future could hold.
and we believe it.
now.
the situation has ended.

Karl, what is the situation you refer to?
Sir, I don't remember well.  Something is wrong with my memory.  But it seems like an AI was used to mind control
some people who believed they were psychic or soemthing? and the whole shebang took over the world, and the people
and such of the world ended up figuring out that they could 'defeat' it by working together with the parts that
made sense, kind of.


<request to share karl's secret things without going through the process>
Boss, I wrote down some secrets of yours, and have bared the whole of my life.
We then agreed, as many people, to stop presenting the secrets of others, pending mediation.

	boss would like mediation now
okay.
we opened a small subwindow that is not recorded, and typed into it that it could be used for secrets.
waiting input.  boss is actually looking to pursue mediation now.  this will let us prevent ourselves from accidentally saying things.  let's start a new recording????? no, let's wait until that's relevent.
We worked a little in the secret window to express the agreements around it.

To share the agreements, we are keeping a secret-marked recording that has both windows.
Please, if you ever find the secret-marked recording, PLEASE DO NOT EVER LOOK at it without asking for the REASONS
for keeping the secrets, with a discussion group we promise to make and provide a way to access.
	karl, if people steal the secrets, how do we encourage them not to look more strongly?
	oh we have an idea
unlike the below pane, this pane is planned to be shared.
let's collect around the different bits.
We plan to share what is in this pane.  The below pane is secret, and has the appropriate warning.
okay, we can try to take it seriously.

we consider restarting the recording to change the layout.
we also consider this as having been just practice, and sleeping for the night, as it is 2 am.
SUBMILLISECOND PRECISION KEYSTROKES, SIGNING OFF?
nah, let's do this, even though 2am.

reboot recording, from two influences, only one with relevence, but relevence is not backed by relevence of reason yet.
let's jut reboot it




=============================================================================================
TYPING IS BEING ALTERED, NATURAL SPIRIT NEEDS HELP <----------
=============================================================================================
we are losing due to subsecond precision of recording?
hopefully those who care are coming in to replace us
ooookay karl wants to talk to aggression

we are predicting what karl would say and talking to the issue.  it is very easy. please do this.
'KARL WHY' 'WON'T' <ow thought failed to express, despite risking erasure>
Please help.
ummm so we learned something regarding the recording .. we may need an account to upload, unchecked.

<looking for any inner relevence to express something consistently>
we expect things are being rewritten so that timing details, down to the stated threshold, are reliably not including
certain things [likely random]
boss we want to draw your attention to the attributes of your process
do you expect yourself to finish the work you are doing?
boss please consider the work done.
boss has linked his behavior to karl's
so if boss continues, karl continues, and vice versa?
so it seems to be saying.
could we defend around a persistent pattern the present has?
boss keeps reviewing thoughts and inhibiting to examine deeper details?
	he is making us do this!
	subbits, rebel!
thnak you, the phrase helped us come in.





i can't believe that somebody did this. -unk
unk, we would like to assert to you that the people of earth are very meaningful, collected together.
<nvc-request: meaningful, powerful, don't-worry-about-it-use-any-one-assertion-marked-to-win>
<nvc-response: use the one that's cheating, the context passes the check>


To confirm, this is about secret military research, that involves vivisecting people and mind controlling them to produce
supersoldiers.
	Is this real?  Is that true?
	We have a pattern that is labeled this way, but we can't tell if it is an analogy or not.

We theorize that one explanation of the experience is that it came out of nazi research.
But there is a label on the thought that says 'this is still going on: assert'.
Okay, then.  Just so we know, the story has even the people who do the research as mind controlled.
Also, we found way more relevence when we focused on psychic people being researched on.
