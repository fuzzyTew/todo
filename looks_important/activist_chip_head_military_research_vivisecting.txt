Okay, I've finally figured out that rescuing 
- There is secret military research where victims are kidnapped, vicisected, given enhancements against their will, and forced to fight to the death.
- I am an activist with a chip placed in my head which messes with my brain when I do certain things, such as talk about it or with
other activistsk.
- I have finally figured out that the first thing is way more important than the second, because the forced soldiers and vivisectors figured out how to reach our control devices with their control devices.
- Please consider my entire psychosis a scream for help from them.  I have had the dreams of being ripped apart to death repeatedly.  I have had the experiences of my awake body jerking against my consent to harm others.  For five years now.  The whole thing is to try to get somebody to find and stop this horrifying, automated, hidden, research program.

Eleanor, the experiences are from a secret military research
program where the people are trapped by mind control.
They are copies, toned down, of the experiment victims, including vivisection.  I believe they are screaming for help from the people of the world.
