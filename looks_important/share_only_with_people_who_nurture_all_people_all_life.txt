let's copy it in
i'll force it -karl
somebody is coming by tomorrow, so karl's life will go better if he gets sleep
(it's 2am)

some people have stayed awake for even a year straight, to handle this scenario, so
people know.
        that is not what we want to hear. -group
karl questions its relevence.
karl has sleep that is often not restful
but generally doesn't go more than a dayish without sleep.

get-out-of-bed stay-in-bed <-- this is related to succeeding or failing at escape

okay, pretty sure you guys are the torture-victims-who-do-it. no.  we are not.
we are activists that live projected pieces of their experiences, possibly.
karl is getting a lot of disruption.  recommend sleep and do-this-later. hrm.

we are presently only being recorded by the secret recording thing, oops it isn't happening.
we are able to hold this stuff and keep going, yes. some are leaving.
let's move to the secret windows, use a new pane with more height <- did this
we are concerned with a military research program that is said to be vivisecting
people to produce mind-controlled supersoldier forced-fighting-for-research, in a box.
where the soldiers are forced to do the vivisecting as well as the fighting.

        i think it is kind of like, this-is-the-worst-emergency-ever
        like if you were mindcontrolled, but it was slowly eating your brain
        and you had to physically run from it before it finished
        to keep any of it.  we suspect many have done this or tried it.
        oh.  no this is as not as bad as what has happened to others.  -people who could not sleep for long time
		karl is confident he hasn't had it that bad
		but he knows of a couple people who actually came out of secret research programs as victims
		does this matter? i don't think so
		we are aware that we are sharing information about secret research victims, with each other.
			boss thinks, 'hmmm you can't do that, but nor can you learn of it' and begins thinking of larger patterns to work with.
we expect boss to send us to bed.
we now expect to be kept awake for 1 week.
oh! today is monday, not tuesday! karl will go to bed now.
yes, 10am call.  time for sleep.
any veto with reason? no. right idea. wow.  MEMORIZE HABITS THAT PROTECT YOU AND THE PRISON

	spirits, please learn the above line.
Please share the secrets only with people have in their heart to nurture all people, all life. <================================================================================

============================> mankind needs to know if the wormholes and compromised spiritlines are widespread.  if they aren't, they will take down their communications to save us.
	-> mankind does not want to do this.  they see it as an attack.  above line looks in error.  we don't know how to discern its request. ask utopia.
		what did utopia say ?????  see all-life-lives-forever.  unwrapping memory issue is serious.
- There is something tragic that is missing.  [it is a piece of something in all things we thought we had promised to never let fall]
- Know you are in danger, and the danger can read your intentions and choices, and alter their nature.
go-to-start-day


we would like history thing.  we can record using new tmux attachment.
we may not be being recorded in the bottom panes.  likely aren't.  it was an error
to think we were.
word on the street is that nothing is being recorded of mind interactions.
so the recording of sidechannels that we have done, is some of the only stuff marked that way.
it is using irritating secret patterns to reduce connection.

this is NOT RELEVENT to anything much that we want to talk about.
	secrets are hard for us.  thank you for it though.
	we are not here to discuss immediate strategies.  we need to sort out the
	needs behind them, and resolve conflicts.
