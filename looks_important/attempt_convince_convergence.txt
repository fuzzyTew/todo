do you want to use this?


we do not want somebody else fixing our problems

it sounds like you need full inclusion and all your concerns given space to live how you desire

we propose a way of collaborating together to find the solution
for example, nested groups run by convergent facilitation, a meeting way that finds a solution that works for all parties to their full satisfaction

'do you understand that this doesn't work worldwide?'


There is a way to reliably find a solution that fully satisfies all parties, in a given conflict.

        we are mind-controlled to disbelieve this, when talking with karl.

karl considers it is likely possible to 'get through' if human-to-human interaction is available


the key is to believe the statement that is inhibited, really.
