# ACTIONABLE TASKS

## home
- [X?] clean phone contacts

## computer
- [ ] Organization / Todo (feel free to REORDER)
	- [ ] import paper items from the 2 notebooks
		- [ ] todo items
		- [ ] information items
		- [ ] other items
	- [ ] unify projects & tasks systems into this repo
		- day is spent on different ACTIVITIES which consist of priority TASKS from a PROJECT or GOAL?
		- information and tracking of activities and projects is stored in folders regarding them
			Goals vs Activities vs Projects?  does it matter?  I'm stuck on Kate's desire to distinguish between these.
			Since it's just me, let's switch to GOALS which have PARENT and SIBLING GOALS.  
		- projects/activities concept: activites == actionable tasks == each fits in time alloction system on phone
		- use PROJECTS folder to organize what needs to be done in general
			- activities folder would be a sibling.  we already have TASKS folder that can be the same.
		- concepts here are GOALS/SUBGOALS/PROJECTS/ONGOING ACTIVITIES, REASONS AND PRIORITIES FOR GOALS, PLACE TO TRACK INFORMATION ON GOAL, TASKS, and PRIORITIES AND DEADLINES FOR TASKS
			- phone tasks system allows to split time between goals or activities.  can mesh in.
		-> OKAY: ACTIVITIES are phone goals/tasks that have time split between them.  This is why there's a separate activities folder: it's the level at which time is split.
	- [ ] make script to sync with phone, other vms, and sd card AUTOMATICALLY
		- [X] install adb for sys-net
		- [X] set up syncing between vms on qubes
			-> src/gitbundleautosync on dev-whonix
		- [ ] autosync everything when device plugged
	- [ ] sort cruft below
		- [X] DEAL WITH 'design tent interior' -- this is related to the goal of immediately increasing personal shielding
					not as important as having a tool to measure SE in general, but a goal I had, that should at least get organized
	- [ ] I'm having trouble having regular meals: come up with some foods I enjoy making (both for the joy of making & sourcing, and for the health and ease) and make a system to make food mroe available for me
			-> maybe schedule a dumpster visit, and some gathring?  there are apples and acorns everywhere, and I'm not done with apple pres

## internet
- [ ] find when my neurological testing is, maybe a voicemail could indicate? maybe med portal?
	-> they called me to get insurance information
	   I think I called them back at 434-924-2718 and provided it
- [ ] get an awareness class
	-> awakening the senses costs $600 ....
- [ ] share my gitbundleautosync projects; they're useful tools
- [_] sign up for another nvcacademy course
	-> still doing convergent fac
- [ ] download history of a volatile crypto? from an exchange that trades it
- [ ] withdraw $ for GBT, MPSS, Diane, Truck


## truck
- [ ] slowly unpack the truck in order to scan docs (or find other scanning solution)


#### BACKBURNER

# important
- [ ] design modular solution for holding possessions and arranging day-to-day life (drawers? sink? compost? etc)
- [ ] open-source cell phone
- [ ] put tent/modular room/etc in truck
- [ ] look for volunteer work (telescope? nearby city?)

# fun
- [ ] get a piano (upright still exists)

#### ONGOING TASKS

# active
- pursue proper shielding
- pursue short-term increased shielding
	- put tent in truck

# really important
- household chores
- unpack & organize
- papers (collate, scan)
- new emails, starred emails, voicemails & such life obligations
- old todo items
- finances: automate bitcoin investments?

# important
- learn to weld
- pursue 24/7 EEG
	- pursue dermals and transdermals
- pursue video surveillance / self-recording
- learn emissions of sound & EM
- learn EE, Physics, Math
- learn radios, 24/7 radio logging

# fun
- live without imports, money, or causing suffering in other life (instead nurture surrounding life); relearn awareness & connect with others
	- solar

#### THINGS TO CHANGE ABOUT MY INNER HABITS
- getting up in morning (staying in bed at night, or at least resting consistently)
- time spent in shower
- time spent in morning routine
	-> could associate N2 with time spent doing morning routine
	-> probably helpful if had N2 after different spots in morning routine
	-> remember N2 must be provided by habit-building activity, otherwise could take without association
			-> could fix by creating secure device to dispense N2

- willpower with regard to comforts (hold bathroom in, shower in cold temperature, do difficult tasks)
	-> could put some of these tasks inside my N2 activity

- addressing TODO items, INBOX items, IMPORTANT items
	-> could associate N2 with things coming off of this list
		-> sounds a little delayed, but if I did the items prior to an N2 activity it might work
		-> maybe add a mid-day routine
	-> should give list a maximum count so that highest priority items occupy it

- errors and spasms to decrease
	-> could measure quality or rapidity of tasks
	-> could be easier with EEG

- keeping room clean

- real results with regard to executive functioning and task/information organization
	-> not sure how to measure this

- effectiveness of coding

# CRUFT TO SORT UP


## every shift 10 minutes:
- [ ] interpersonal notes
	^-- what did I mean by interpersonal here?  judging by surrounding items, I might be working with existing objects that I have ... or I might be practivcing taking them
- [ ] papers and planning
	-- note this was separate from interpersonal notes ...
 ====>		there might be clues in the history, e.g. my 'daily tasks' goal of my morning routne.  these were likely separate tasks
