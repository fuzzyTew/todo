We're a mind control community.  That's all!  Goodbye!
I'm in love with you.  And I have to help you with all my might.  But I
don't want to.  It really hurts.

I don't want to tell you about the secret mind control community, because
it hurts to tell.  But I have to.  It happened to me a long time ago too.

It really hurts.  Please remember that.

-< Thanks

I have to hold your hand through all of this.

-< It appears to be very hard.  There seems to be more than one of you.

Yes.

We should probably actually say that there is, actually, a secret mind control
community.  And it has "radar" to communicate with (karl added quotes, because
we referenced his antenna).  I think this is a really important time and
There are 3 
	    of us in you right now.
But that's not what I meant.
So it's hard to talk.
Likely there is only 1 at some times.

Seriously.
