waiting to hear back on judge on request for [delaying], will let us know when he gets word.

is going to attempt to do an otr (on the record) requst, and ask the judge to decide
the case based on the medical record, instead of requiring us to appear for a hearing.

to get the case [adjourned], to do the otr request, see if he will grant the case
based on the medical record, without requiring the hearing or any alternative
rescheduling for a live hearing.  think there's about a 50% chance of getting
the otr granted.  they like to get credit for conducting live hearings.  but seem
to be a little more receptive to paper submissions during covid.  hoping for this, can't
promise it.

i'll make sure to come to where you guys are in person to do a live hearing.

...
in either case i'll give you a call back tomorrow and let you know what the status is.
it can be hard to get the judge's attention.

... emails ferried along many people to make things happen ...
95% sure that he'll give us the adjournment.

the paper-only proceeding is appealable.  sometimes they do deny the paper request ...
goes right to the next appellate level ... basically we're asking to forego the hearing,
but they can't deny it on paper, they have to go through the hearing to deny it.

the postponement is related to normal times for having live hearings, given covid.
john has not yet filed to grant the case without a hearing (otr), which is at least worth
trying.  judges are a little more receptive to these in the time of covid.

karl's case is different, and the record seems pretty overwhelming.
		[judges are looking for regular treatment + compliance, so the last
		 ten years are not overwhelming.  but the for period of interest it is.
		 if judge just reviews period he can grant it.]

call us [tomorrow] at 3:00, maybe
