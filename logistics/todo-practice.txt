TODO:
 - let's do 3 todo things in a cycle, to interweave practice with productivity
 - [x] put something on a todo list and do it
 - [x] label two items in these lists with two different properties they have, that could be useful for organizing them
 - [x] organize the two items in some way using their properties
 - [ ] specify a hierarchical relationship between two properties, adding one or two new ones if helpful
            REASON [might want to change item if not helping]: ORGANIZE THIS TODO LIST
 	- [ ] if this is hard, one idea is adding a few more properties to things
    - note: things are hierarchical when all the properties of the larger one describe
      the smaller one, but not the other way around. hierarchies include groups, categories,
      and reasons.
            [now / later]
            [part / general]
            [relevent-concept]
