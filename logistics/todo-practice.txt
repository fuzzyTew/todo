PRACTICE TODO LIST

NORM: [considering split: stays same vs checks off, or ongoing vs completable]
 - let's do 3 todo things in a cycle, to interweave practice with productivity
            - ongoing

SUMMARY:
    

TODO:
 - [x] put something on a todo list and do it
 - [x] label two items in these lists with two different properties they have, that could be useful for organizing them
 - [x] organize the two items in some way using their properties

 - [ ] write a summary of the contents of this todo list
        - [x] set aside a section for the summary
        - [ ] summarise the first 4 items into it
        - [ ] summarise the remaining items

 - [ ] specify a hierarchical relationship between two properties, adding one or two new ones if helpful
                detail
            REASON [might want to change item if not helping]: ORGANIZE THIS TODO LIST
 	- [ ] if this is hard, one idea is adding a few more properties to things
    - note: things are hierarchical when all the properties of the larger one describe
      the smaller one, but not the other way around. hierarchies include groups, categories,
      and reasons.
            [now / later]
            [part / general]
            [relevent-concept]
 - [ ] add an item to a list that you actually want or need to do
 - [ ] do the item you added

            this is now the whole todo list, first 20 seconds
        -* [ ] organise and do this larger todo list
                - [ ] let's try to simplify/consolidate something
                    note: this is really hard, and useful, both.

           ===>        ---> ?   it might be helpful to do just a little, then move on, each
                                time

                    an idea was dedicating more than 1/3rd of available time to it.
                            we want to get good at properties, whether written or used or both
             halted cycling so as to build/retain-built executive skill here
                    REASON is big category, propose most important
                    doesn't need to be perfect.
                    - one of the reasons organising is challenging is because we
                      can have experiences of amnesiatic inhibition, where the labels
                      we use stop making sense, new ones making more sense.
                      this presently appears to be the reason for writing their details.
                    simplicity, clarity, topicality


        cycle
        - [ ] ensure i have a calendar, and then make steps to use
                there is CALENDAR is 00-Organizer.txt
                its last entry is 2019-03-26, a tuesday. it's OLD-TO-NEW.
                - [ ] make a new calendar history doc to quickly resolve concern around history order and existing items
                - [ ] make a section at top of calendar, and start current calendar there.
        - * [ ] organise my things
            - [ ] put different parts from power supply project into sorted places
                    GUESSING THAT MOST OF THIS CAN GO IN A NEW PLACED BOX THAT CAN BE LABELED "WIRING"
                    CAN WE GET SOME PLASTIC BAGS FROM KITCHEN?
                    - [ ] discern if get plastic bags from kitchen
                            [could we just grab some during some non-todo time?]
            - [ ] put laptops under wall label
    ideas for spending time on:
        - [ ] eeg
            - larger goal: [record of crucial cognitive changes]
        - [ ] dual n-back etc
        - [ ] data preservation
        - [ ] secure phone / pocket device
        - [ ] awareness/fox-walking
        - [ ] cold outdoors
        some of these may be overlappable with others. thinking maybe avoid binding specifically with though.

Ideas for things to regularly pick some of:
 - [ ] make another todo list
 	- small-practice
	- * develops high priority skill
	- * part of current task
    - larger goal: resume-todo-list

Major goals:
 - [ ] totoal-todo-list
     - [ ] combine old todo list
     	- big-job
    	- long-term
    	- * big long term goal
    	- larger goal: total-todo-list
     - [ ] organise items in todo list [this looks like could merge with previous one]
 - [ ] add things from other contexts


TODO:
 - [ ] merge other todo lists
 - [ ] organise goals, values
 - [ ] organise possessions

 - [ ] make/use a schedule for things that are scheduled

 - nicbox

 - [ ] make shopping list


TODO for practice x'ing things:
 - [x] pick up and place down an object from floor.
 - [x] move a nearby object
 - [x] pick up and place down an object needing organising
