TODO:
 - let's do 3 todo things in a cycle, to interweave practice with productivity
 - [x] put something on a todo list and do it
 - [x] label two items in these lists with two different properties they have, that could be useful for organizing them
 - [x] organize the two items in some way using their properties
 - [ ] specify a hierarchical relationship between two properties, adding one or two new ones if helpful
 	- [ ] if this is hard, one idea is adding a few more properties to things
 - [ ] add an item to a list that you actually want or need to do
 - [ ] do the item you added

        cycle
        -* [ ] organise and do this todo list

            - [ ] indoor XO computers: let's pick a place to put them
                - -> the XO i saw is already in the laptop box

        - [ ] secure phone / pocket device
        - [ ] awareness/fox-walking
