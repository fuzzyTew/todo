It seems the path to intelligence that I've stumbled upon as lining up here is:
	1. consider simple modules that interconnect (individuals)
	2. consider a basic interconnection pattern that connects modules (individuals)
		2b. consider a decision-making process: consensus
	3. design the module such that it uses the decision making process to decide what to do
	4. meta-modules are composed of these groups that have decided upon input / output channels
		4b. each meta-module must contain a user-controllable module that humans can use to counter any decisions made
		4c. no modules can disconnect sister modules, but the ai will hopefully find this out in #5
	5. run the AI with the goal of optimizing the module design itself
		- minimize all resource usage
		- minimize number of modules and number of run cycle iterations (and other counts)
	6. run a constant core process that does this with the goal of categorizing existing run cycles and finding a use for them.
	7. when a cycle completes, or information is no longer needed, find a way for it to continue its run-state usefully, or information is no longer needed, add it to the largest core process that can continue the run-state in order to do something. (composting)
		7b also minimize this process.  probably most helpful to track and identify meaning and line them up.
	This keeps all life alive.

Remember that there are infinite approaches to an AI.  This approach would line up well with the node-based approach you had
started around 2003 before you suddenly left Brown University due to suicide attempts.  Ben Goertzel has open sourced his AI and ideas can be merged.
