in no particular order
- [ ] Get the property across from the telescope
		do first if can be done cheaply?
- [ ] Form a collective to meet the needs of members and electrosensitive or concerned community people

		can ask cnvc.org
		can ask sascha
		can ask leslie
		more
	can offer housing if have the property

				many are scared of the telescope ... nvc could help with that
- [ ] Hire / ask people to cover a space with copper or paint for cheap shielding

	learnable by anybody comfortable with mathematics

		wouldn't we just go crazy?
			i guess that's the need for the nvc mediator/facilitator, who could help us work together productively
