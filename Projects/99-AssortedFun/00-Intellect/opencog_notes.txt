ContextLink:
	1st node: ConceptNode context
	2nd node: EvaluationLink relevent within context

Execution:
	SequentialAnd does things in order.
	DefinedPredicate can be used to reference itself in a loop, etc.
	for user interaction, will need to call out to scheme or c++ or etc
	Put/Get/Bind can be used in SequentialAnd to alter state predictably.  State[Link] is good for
		this, as it overwrites itself when re-put.
