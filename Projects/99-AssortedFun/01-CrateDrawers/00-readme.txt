An attempt to create stackable drawers for organization, and to make it easy to see my possessions.

This folder may be symlinked as a subfolder of freecad's Mod folder,
in for example ~/.FreeCAD/Mod .

Then the python modules may be imported from the python console in freecad,
and if an InitGui.py file is ever created, a workbench might be used.

[WHYYYYYY MILKCRATES ?????? :P]
[I have a lot of milkcrates]
[YOU STOLE MILKCRATES !!!]
[i'll return them after I make something to replace them? ;p]
[please call an authority and let them you know you have illegal milkcrates]
[I'm willing to do this, but it is pretty late at night]
		[you don't think you'll get in trouble for stealing the milkcrates?]
			[I don't think it would be any significant trouble ... often people are given milkcrates when expresing guilt or concern around taking them]
				[that won't be the case anymore.  don't you worry.]
	[what is a milkcrate exactly?]
		[it's a hard plastic box, I think for storing milk containers in.  it's sturdy and stackable.]
			[what do you use them for?]
				[storing things in]
					[why are they an issue?]
		[is it a problem to ask about them?  want to make sure our resources are used effectively, mistakes could make us inefficient] ummm ... karl wrote this imagining writing for somebody else
	<So.  Karl stole some milkcrates.>
		Yes, I did.
		<Has he been suitably punished?>
			This was before my unrelenting punishment started.
				<So you don't feel guilty about this?>
					I'm mostly worried about designing something that works better than milkcrates for me.
		(why did you believe it was good to steal milkcrates?)
			I perceived the whole world operating by theft, thinking of people stealing
			land and lives from wild animals and native people.
				I felt buying things from stores was theft, because the money
				was often used in ways that harmed other cultures and beings.
