Robotic creations of fantasy golems as seen in movies and games.
Parts must float, separate from each other.
Golem is themed to appear to be made all from a same kind of thing: 'fire golem' 'mud golem' 'water golem'.
hey maybe we can make the golems fly some day!  could the ones with propellant use it to fly?  maybe a second prototype could look into some way to fly?

Possibilities:
	Can use pumps to send fluid mateiral between components, from reservoirs inside components.
	Can use transparent materials with same IOR as water for water golem, and hide non-transparent materials with tricky reflectiveness.
	Main point: hovering components via electromagnets, programmed to move them around with a ton of magnetism and current.

Basically, in order to make _any_ of this, the central problem of levitating parts needs to be solved more thoroughly.
I'm pretty sure parts could hold electromagnets and permanent magnets in such a way as to spin around each other etc. in a planned manner.
I'm missing some of the engineering details of how magnetic fields are at a distance from coils, and how magnets exert precise forces on each other.
I could try to remember or derive this stuff, but more likely I will look it up.
Plan:
- [X] Look up enough magnets formulas to plan a levitating component.
	note that I live in an area where wireless transmission is illegal, so powering the levitating parts could use some creativity
- [ ] Design a levitating component.
- [ ] Build the levitating component, and discern why it fails.
- [ ] Repeat until it works.

Prototype:
	an object that levitates in the air, _to the side_ of a fixed base without touching it or being above it,
	and can move around in some way programmatically.
