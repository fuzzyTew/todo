A CURRENT-CARRYING WIRE produces a CIRCULAR MAGNETIC FIELD.  The direction is by the right-hand rule.
								(fingers point north, thumb against electrons)

The regularity of the field lines around a coil breaks down very close to the wires, naturally.

The FLUX of an electromagnet is like a bar magnet, and directly proportional to the amount of current.

Magneto Motive Force (m.m.f., ampere turns) = I x N
	I = current
	N = turns in coil

The wires in a coil attract and repel each-other due to their aligned (attract) or disaligned (repel) fields.

B = Magnetic Field (flux density, Tesla, T) = mu H
mu = absolute permeability
mu_0 = permeability of a vacuum = 4 pi 10^-7 H/m
mu_r = relative permeability = mu / mu_0 = flux density in material / flux density in vacuum
	diamagnetic: _less_ permeable than vaccum: water, copper, silver, gold
	paramagnetic: only _slightly_ more permeable than vacuum: gases, magnesium, tantalum
	                   _slightly_ attracted to magnets
       mu_r is equal to the ratio that flux density increases in an electromagnet core of that material
		but note that materials can be QUICKLY SATURATED: mu_r will change as B changes
			this can be predited from a B-H curve (magnetisation curve, magnetic hysteresis curve)
			Steel: good to BM = 1.2, H = 1000 At/m, then slowly rises to BM = 1.5 at 3000 At/m
			Iron: best to BM = 0.2 but curves to BM = 0.6 at 3000 At/m
				producing flux density requires aligning domains in the material
		but air and vacuum have constant mu_r = 1 regardless of B
	soft iron?: mu = 80 mH/m; mu_r = 64k
H = Magnetising Force (ampere-turns/meter, At/m)
B_R = Residual Magnetism (also the max theoretical power of a permanent magnet)
H_C = Coercive Force

Coil: H = I x N / L
		L is length of coil in meters
Line: H = I / (2 pi r)
		r is distance from line wire

Core Retentivity
	B-H curve can be used to discern field as a function of H within a core,
	but when H drops B can stay, held by the core.  This is called Retentivity or Remanence.
	B_R is still remaining in core.
	H_C can be applied to return H to zero.

	A Magnetic Hysterisis Loop shows the behavior of a ferromagnetic core undergoing changing current.
	Since response to H depends on past H, this chart can predict the ratio.
	Soft Magnetic Materials such as those with silicon added have narrow loops and little retentivity.
	Hysteresis Loss = work lost to heat from applying H_C to core
	

At a distance, magnetic field is generally described by a DIPOLE FIELD characterized by total
	MAGNETIC DIPOLE MOMENT = m (A m^2 or At m^2)
	Strength falls off inversely with the cube of the distance from the center.
	m is a vector pointing north

	m = IA  (as A approaches 0 as a limit)
		I = current through loop (even true in magnetic materials, small loops)
		A = area of loop
	Gilbert model:
	m = q_m d
		q_m = magnetic charge (equal and opposite on ends of magnet)
		d = distance between ends

	Force is because of Lorentz forces on current loops.
	F = gradient (m dot B)
	    gradient is just rate of change over space
	    direction is that of maximum increase of m dot B
	large magnets may need integration

	Gilbert model:
		F = mu q_m1 q_m2 / (4 pi r^2)
			q_m = magnitude of pole (A m)
			mu = permeability of intervening medium
			r = separation

		Simplifications:
		Magnetized surfaces, no fringing, air gap smaller than magnet:
			F = mu_0 H^2 A/2 = B^2 A / (2 mu_0)
				A = area of each surface
				H = magnetizing field
				B = flux density
		Distant cylinderical bar magnets end-to-end:
			F = B_0^2 A^2 (L^2 + R^2) / (pi mu_0 L^2) (1/x^2 + 1/(x+2L)^2 - 2/(x + L)^2)
				B_0 = flux density very close to each pole
				A = pole area
				L = magnet length
				R = magnet radius
				x = separation
				note that B_0 = (mu_0/2) M
					M = magnetization of magnet

	NOTE: nearby magnets affect each other!! they induce current, they magnetise.  see "magnetic circuit" ?

	Ampere:
		Sufficiently distant magnets to approximate as dipoles:
			B = (mu_0 / (4 pi r^3)) (3(m dot rhat)rhat - m) + (2 mu_0 / 3) m delta^3(|r|)
				r = vector from other dipole to measurement location
				rhat = unit vector
				m = dipole moment
				delta^3 = three-dimensional delta function, integral is 1 and is zero everywhere except (0,0,0), so last term falls off
			This can be simplified by shifting the coordinate system:
				m_1 is the origin
				z axis points in the direction of m_1
				B_z = (mu_0 / 4 pi) m_1 (3 cos^2 theta - 1)/r^3
				B_x = (mu_0 / 4 pi) m_1 (3 cos theta sin theta ) / r^3
			F(r, m1, m2) = // force of m1 on m2
				( 3 mu_0 / (4 pi r^5) ) ( (m1 dot r) m2 + (m2 dot r) m1 + (m1 dot m2) r - 5(m1 dot r)(m2 dot r) r / |r|^2 )
				r is from m1 to m2
				force on m1 is in opposite direction

			wikipedia "Force between magnets" has final formulas but they are expressed in
				terms of angles.


For planning of magnets and currents, we'll need a concept of how force relates to distance, moment, flux, and At.
	We can simplify and assume end-to-end magnets.
		F = -3 mu_0 m1 m2 / 2 pi r^4
		F = 3 m^2 mu_0 / 2 pi r^4
		F = 3 m^2 4 pi 10^-7 H/m / 2 pi r^4
		F = 6e-7 H/m m^2 / r^4

		it's looking like m _might_ be 1/mu_0 B V
			B is the flux density
			V is the volume
		but for solenoids one usually uses m = NIS

		F = 6e-7 H/m N^2 I^2 S^2 / r^4

- single-core wire carries the highest current
- wire attributes we care about are current carrying capacity and outer diameter.
  We want to maximize IN, current * loops, where each loop is outer-diameter thick
  so total loops = length / diameter
	IN = I * L / D
	L is constant
	maximize I / D

	It really looks like the thicker the wire is, the stronger the magnet is, which doesn't match
	my experience of seeing electromagnets with very thin wire.
	This assumes it's still skinny enough to form multiple loops.

	Copper foil can carry a current:
		I = 0.024 dT^0.44 A^0.725
			    dT = max rise in temperature in Deg C
			     A = cross-sectional area in mil^2 (0.001 in)^2
			     I is in Amp

		It's notable that current is proportional to area^0.725.
		By factorization, current should be proportional to thickness^0.725 for pcb trace thicknesses.
		This means MORE WRAPS is better than MORE MATERIAL !! This is the opposite of what's gotten
		for wires =S
		

	ALSO NOTE: we can give a core to multiply strength by many magnitudes
	It looks like it's normal to use AWG 30 magnet wire.
	You gain a little from making the wire larger, but the current must increase a lot.
