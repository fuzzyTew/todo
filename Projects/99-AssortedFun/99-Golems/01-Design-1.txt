FIRST PROTOTYPE:
	Fixed Base, plugs in, powers electromagnets.
	Floating Component, with permanent magnets.
remember, no oscillating fields cause we live in green bank !!!!
TOWARDS THE END GOAL OF A TINY WALKING GOLEM !!!!
		or even procedural plans for a golem of user-chosen size !
			waitwait what if a user makes a giant city-destroying golem? ????????
				i think htey would be arrested but there would be a big huge community golem
				sold at auction or something

I'd like to be able to levitate the magnets an inch to the side of the base.
- [X] find the kind of magnet with highest power / mass (likely neodymium)
	-> note: dimensions of magnet affect behavior?
	
	These magnets have maximum temperatures depending on the neodymium material type.
	It can range from 176 F 80 C through 428 F 220 C.
	Don't appear to have any problem with cold.

	Neodymium magnetis are ~7.45 g/cm^3.  There's more at https://www.kjmagnetics.com/specs.asp
		- they also reshape a little proportional to temperature and stresses and it's predictable.

	The magnetically strongest neodymium materialtype is N52.  It only goes to 176 F.

	We'll likely want the lightest, smallest magnet, which is about a mm wide.
	Magnets are specd with a detailed graph of the field shape, but m can be calculated with
		m = 1/mu_0 Br V
			where V is magnet volume.
	Smallest magnet is D101-N52.
		Weight: 0.0118 g
		1/16" diameter, 1/32" thick ->
			-> 0.00157109008 cm^3, which matches mass
	D101-N52
		dia = 1/16 in
		height = 1/32 in
		V = pi * (1/32 in)^3 = 0.0015709008 cm^3
		Brmax = 14800 G = 1.48 T
		m = 1/mu_0 Br V
		m = 0.00185034597 Am^2
		
- [ ] plan how many will be needed to actually function (remember 3 dimensions)


	okay, it's like we're pulling with strings and pushing with sticks.
	we're going to need to be able to move it left/right, up/down, and in/out as it drifts, to maintain.
	orientation will matter too ....
	
		to move it up:
			push diagonally on top / pull diagonally on bottom
			-> results in horizontal force too, need to counter with other magnet
		I think we can do this with only _one_ magnet.

		but say is has drifted below or above the side-force magnet.
			forces will increase in order to not send magnet to or fro.
			in extreme, magnet is balanced between the two and it won't quite work.
			can counter with another magnet on base or on component.

		to move it left and right .....

	if the magnet is situated between two electromagnets, then what?
			one could push super hard, the other pull super harder, and this would move it parallel
			both could pull and this would move it towards / away
			BUT if the magnet spins, we're likely in trouble.
	if the magnet is above just one, we've already seen it would work (unless it spins)
	if the magnet is beyond both, then ...
			one could push really hard, and the other could pull really hard until a component reaches zero, right?

			a N, theta = 60 deg
			b N, phi = 70 deg

			cos(theta) * a + cos(phi) * b = 0
				yeah we can cancel these out.

	so the big problem with only 1 magnet is that it will spin to align its poles.  do we need anothe rmagnet?

	
			N
				S N
			N

			N	S
				
			S	N

		I think another magnet would help, or a really long magnet.

			N      N

			N      S

			N		S


			S		S

		it's hard to solve for this without oscillation.

			I think it owuld help to consider magnetic monopoles.
			I settle don looking to solve it algebraically based on the formula for force and torque.
			The restraint will be that the torque is zero, we want to freely control the force.  So this will decide hte number of electromagnets needed.

- [ ] calculate needed specs of base.



How can we engage in mediation when our brains are talking with each other?
	I still think it's valuable and notable that it has worked successfully in normal situations.
			including street gangs, warfare, etc ...

		no, I mean hvaing to do with privacy and secrets.
			I'm not aware of the details, but it does sound difficult.  Maybe mediation is
			needed elsewhere first.
