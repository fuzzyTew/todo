FIRST PROTOTYPE:
	Fixed Base, plugs in, powers electromagnets.
	Floating Component, with permanent magnets.
remember, no oscillating fields cause we live in green bank !!!!
TOWARDS THE END GOAL OF A TINY WALKING GOLEM !!!!

I'd like to be able to levitate the magnets an inch to the side of the base.
- [ ] find the kind of magnet with highest power / mass (likely neodymium)
	-> note: dimensions of magnet affect behavior?
	
	These magnets have maximum temperatures depending on the neodymium material type.
	It can range from 176 F 80 C through 428 F 220 C.
	Don't appear to have any problem with cold.

	Neodymium magnetis are ~7.45 g/cm^3.  There's more at https://www.kjmagnetics.com/specs.asp
		- they also reshape a little proportional to temperature and stresses and it's predictable.

	The magnetically strongest neodymium materialtype is N52.  It only goes to 176 F.

	We'll likely want the lightest, smallest magnet, which is about a mm wide.
	Magnets are specd with a detailed graph of the field shape, but m can be calculated with
		m = 1/mu_0 Br V
			where V is magnet volume.
	Smallest magnet is D101-N52.
		Weight: 0.0118 g
		1/16" diameter, 1/32" thick ->
			-> 0.00157109008 cm^3, which matches mass
	D101-N52
		dia = 1/16 in
		height = 1/32 in
		V = pi * (1/32 in)^3 = 0.0015709008 cm^3
		m = ?
		
- [ ] plan how many will be needed to actually function (remember 3 dimensions)
- [ ] calculate needed specs of base.
