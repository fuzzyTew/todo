Techniques for expert sudoku:

	- Exclusive Group: a group of n squares that can only have n unique numbers in them, in 
	  a column, row, or 3x3 square.  These numbers can be removed from all other members of
	  the column, row, or 3x3 square, because those n squares would be unsolvable if they
	  couldn't solely contain those numbers.
	
	- When there's an "exclusive group" with more than two members (a triplet or quadruplet),
          and one of the numbers in it resides entirely in some other group, that number may be
	  removed from other squares in that other group.
	  The reason for this is that if it were present in those squares, it would have to be
	  removed from the triplet or quadruplet, which would make the puzzle unsolvable.
