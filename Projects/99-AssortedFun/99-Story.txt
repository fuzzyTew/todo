goal is not to figure anything out, but give gratificatoin of expressing scenarios similar to experiences

outline ideas
- development of mediation through enforcers of distant, disparate conflict (<- this could also use a suffering-becomes-hero)
	note: this is needed most badly.  is non-present in media.
- intellect cracking (unauthorized detailed observation, alteration, or control), multiple methods
- intellect comprehension and construction (<- put a karl-suffering-validation-becomes-hero here? -voice)
	note: karl wants to make one where the two above both have extensive new detail
- delusion by other, extended
	- like matrix
- coercion, real or only-apparent
- alternate realities overlapping with simulated experiences
	- maybe have 2 realities, but leave it ambiguous if 1 member is in sim, or has access to exotic tech
- cointelpro-references, global-surveillance-references

collected-together ideas:
- real mediation through harmful exotic, misleading experiences

Stranger Things (tv show) has a good percentage of the above parts, and patterns could be copied to create content
	new forms of coercion entered in 3rd season
	experimentee character also had superpowers, helped people in analogous situations
		we thought somebody who built an AI could be nice -voice

stories:
- 




component forms
sim:
	- dream
	- bubble of imagination in mind
		- relates mind hacking: could spawn an isolated imagination to talk to somebody in their mind
	- computer simulation
	- alternate timeline
	- quantum alternative
	- faked by conspiracy
	- faked by delusion
intellect hacking:
	- [obv, kinda triggering to write out]
goals:
	- altering behaviors of self or others
	- saving self or others from alteration
	- saving world from emergency
	- dominating world
