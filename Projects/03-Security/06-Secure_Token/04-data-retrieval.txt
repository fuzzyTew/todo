Ideally I'd like to get data off of the phone via a controlled channel where I can observe what
goes in and out.

The existing approach is QR codes, but it is laborious for large amounts of data.

I can also insert and remove SD cards, but I would like to do this only in one direction, to
prevent it being a channel for compromise.

(note: also existing issues of bluetooth radio and no faraday bag; would also like to replace with
new device)
--> replacing with a new device happens rarely.  could have the phone only SEND data, but never
    receive except via keyboard.  sounds reasonable.

I guess for now, I'll put 1 sd card into the phone, and then transfer sd cards _from_ the phone in the future.
		-> hmm if sd card is previously compromised, this would create strong information flow
		but i see that if we use new sd cards there's a long delay involved, seems ok
	maybe useful to have denser data coming off of phone ...  maybe encode to sound file and send via headphone jack.  
		-> I try to avoid plugging wires into the circuitry of my phone.  they can be used to gain more effect of it.
	so ... options then include powering the speaker, using a movable object, or using the display
	i wonder how infeasible it would be to get dense data transfer off the display ...
		maybe if the phone had a holster it could rest in, in front of a camera
		then i wouldn't have to hold it perfectly and hit a button.  it could just sit there
		and transfer.
		if there's maybe 1k in a screenful, and it took 200 ms to read, then we'd get 5k/sec
		transferring 5MB would take 1000s, or 16 min.
		Maybe that's reasonable: the mount.
