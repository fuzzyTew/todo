Ideally I'd like to get data off of the phone via a controlled channel where I can observe what
goes in and out.

The existing approach is QR codes, but it is laborious for large amounts of data.

I can also insert and remove SD cards, but I would like to do this only in one direction, to
prevent it being a channel for compromise.

(note: also existing issues of bluetooth radio and no faraday bag; would also like to replace with
new device)
--> replacing with a new device happens rarely.  could have the phone only SEND data, but never
    receive except via keyboard.  sounds reasonable.

I guess for now, I'll put 1 sd card into the phone, and then transfer sd cards _from_ the phone in the future.
		-> hmm if sd card is previously compromised, this would create strong information flow
		but i see that if we use new sd cards there's a long delay involved, seems ok
	maybe useful to have denser data coming off of phone ...  maybe encode to sound file and send via headphone jack.
