Ideally I'd like to get data off of the phone via a controlled channel where I can observe what
goes in and out.

The existing approach is QR codes, but it is laborious for large amounts of data.

I can also insert and remove SD cards, but I would like to do this only in one direction, to
prevent it being a channel for compromise.

(note: also existing issues of bluetooth radio and no faraday bag; would also like to replace with
new device)
--> replacing with a new device happens rarely.  could have the phone only SEND data, but never
    receive except via keyboard.  sounds reasonable.
