Settle for the near future in West Virginia or Virginia near a highly regulated area of the National Radio Quiet Zone.

PLAN:
Leave on June 26.  Move tent to box truck and live in there until I leave.
- [ ] do adventure, then return
		
- [X] Email Bill & Katie and send phone text from iphone
	-> can't find text, perhaps overwritten by newer texts
- [X] measure height of back of truck where tent will go
	-> 7' 0.5" tallish
	-> .5' bump at back corners
	-> rails leave 5' 1.5" at back
	-> door does not go back as far as rails and leave 7' 6" at back
	-> can go farther forward, door will just not raise all the way
	-> width should lose 1.75" for rails methinks
- [X] check bank balance be sure I can afford lumber (>$3k in bank is fine)
- [X] look for nearby source for lumber
	-> there are a lot of nearby lumber stores but home depot is the
	only place open after 5 on a sunday
- [X] if possible enumerate what they have for plywood to find
	      something just under 0.25"
	-> cheap Ash Harboard Tempered Panel 1/8 in
		$7.12 for 4x8
	Note that the thicker the heavier.  I should probably use 1/8 in
	for all but floor.
- [X] if possible see what they have for ventilation stuff and review choice of cutting vs air-over-top
	-> h-d has rectangular ducts that are 3.25 in tall
- [ ] do 1 outer tent task
- [ ] go to HW store
	-> first look for ventilation stuff, find depth
	-> subtract depth from total height
	- [X] decide to either use decrased height
	      and perhaps get ventilation
	-     or bust hole and get cutoff wheel and grinder
	- [ ] get these things
		- [ ] 12x 3.25 in rectangular vent
			need 2 for a complete vent; each is 3 ft long 10" wid
		- [ ] 4x 3-1/4 in x 1 short way 90 degree rectangular elbow
		- [ ] tin snips
		- [ ] sheet metal screws
		- [ ] 126x studs
			cheapest are 1x2 8ft furring strip board
			$1.32 each
			0.656 in x 1.468 in
		- [ ] 28x panels
			cheapest are 1/8 in 4ft x 8ft ash hardboard tempered panel
			$7.12
		
	- [ ] rerun script with height and get lumber
	- [ ] cut lumber to lengths and sizes
		-> note store may do this faster than you
			they won't be as precise ... but it'll be ok
- [ ] Determine what is felt to be _necessary_ prior to that deaadline
	- [X] my desires
	- [ ] WH/Katie's desires
	- [ ] Dad/Mom's desires
	- [ ] Send an e-mail to Katie and my father to determine their concerns
	- [ ] review my desires, below
    If a desire is pretty hard to meet in a short time scale, refuse to meet
    it or come up with an alternative.
- [ ] Meet necessities.
- [ ] Spend remaining time prior to deadline finishing up things that
      are not necessities.
- [ ] Contact Green Bank Observatory and see if I could pay them to host me even though I am not an astronomer.
- [ ] Review Bear Creek Lodge and Boyer Motel as potential places to stay.

		[ ] redeveloping awareness / spirit

- [X] find measurements of truck and of tent
	I'm going to define a coordinate system for the truck.
	Z is up
	X is right and left
	Y is front and back
	(right, front, up)
	truck: 14' 7/8" long
	       7' 8" wide grows .5" wider at back
	       6' 8 5/8" tall to door frame, 6' 9" tall to door
	       door opening follows curve made by 15" segments hypotenuss at top
	tent outer:
		3 M wide
		2 M deep
		2.3 M tall
	tent inner:
		2.9 M wide
		1.9 M deep
		2.25 M tall (floor has no air space)
- [X] test tent frame dimensions
- [X] determine how to account for airflow.  could bust hole in front of truck box,
      or could direct air over top of tent
	-> leaning towards air over top
- [X] Plan outside tent behavior
- [X] put clothes on
- [X] Come up with a deadline to go.
- [X] Green Bank Observatory itself offers lodging for astronomers.  It's around $80/night.
- [X] I contact one provider of mobile satellite service.  They seemed unfamiliar with the NRQZ, but stated their device was a transmitter and hence would not be allowed in Green Bank.  Elsewhere it is stated that highly directional transmitters may be okay.
- [X] Look into the most highly-regulated hotel in the area.  I could stay there until I can get land.
	- Green Bank Observatory
	- Bear Creek Lodge
	- Boyer Motel
	NOTES
	Green bank lodging:
		Observatory itself
		Bear Creek Lodge: 4.77 mi
		Chestnut Ridge Country Inn: 5.6 mi
		Cass Inn: 5.1 mi
		Boyer Motel & Restaurant: 4.4 mi
	Restrictions are delimited at whole mile numbers up to 10,
	so the best place is the Observatory, and the second best
	is a tie between Bear Creek Lodge and Boyer Motel
	The Sugar Grove station has closed and does not appear the
	best choice here.
