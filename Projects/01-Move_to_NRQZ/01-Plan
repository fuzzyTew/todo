Settle for the near future in West Virginia or Virginia near a highly regulated area of the National Radio Quiet Zone.

PLAN:
Leave on June 26
- [X] find measurements of truck and of tent
	I'm going to define a coordinate system for the truck.
	Z is up
	X is right and left
	Y is front and back
	(right, front, up)
	truck: 14' 7/8" long
	       7' 8" wide grows .5" wider at back
	       6' 8 5/8" tall to door frame, 6' 9" tall to door
	       door opening follows curve made by 15" segments hypotenuss at top
	tent outer:
		3 M wide
		2 M deep
		2.3 M tall
	tent inner:
		2.9 M wide
		1.9 M deep
		2.25 M tall (floor has no air space)
- [ ] Plan outside tent behavior
	- [ ] Plan moving tent to truck.  Do this.
		The tent will occupy the deeper end of the truck back.
		The sides will be bunched up for it to fit.  With 2" spacing
		inbetween each, there is still 7' length to sleep with 2" buffer inside.
		The depth of the tent will be under half of the length of the truck.
		Power will likely be routed underside of truck.
		Tent will not need hooking if an intertent frame is built. This will
		take a small amount of plannable lumber.
			perhaps 2x4s with thin plywood on front and back to push out to
			<= 2"
		i'm curious if tent is taller or shorter than truck
		note also tent will be in back of truck so can be taller than door perhaps!
		
- [ ] Email Bill & Katie and send phone text from iphone
- [ ] do 1 outer tent task
- [ ] Determine what is felt to be _necessary_ prior to that deaadline
	- [X] my desires
	- [ ] WH/Katie's desires
	- [ ] Dad/Mom's desires
	- [ ] Send an e-mail to Katie and my father to determine their concerns

    If a desire is pretty hard to meet in a short time scale, refuse to meet
    it or come up with an alternative.
- [ ] Meet necessities.
- [ ] Spend remaining time prior to deadline finishing up things that
      are not necessities.
- [ ] Contact Green Bank Observatory and see if I could pay them to host me even though I am not an astronomer.
- [ ] Review Bear Creek Lodge and Boyer Motel as potential places to stay.

- [X] Come up with a deadline to go.
- [X] Green Bank Observatory itself offers lodging for astronomers.  It's around $80/night.
- [X] I contact one provider of mobile satellite service.  They seemed unfamiliar with the NRQZ, but stated their device was a transmitter and hence would not be allowed in Green Bank.  Elsewhere it is stated that highly directional transmitters may be okay.
- [X] Look into the most highly-regulated hotel in the area.  I could stay there until I can get land.
	- Green Bank Observatory
	- Bear Creek Lodge
	- Boyer Motel
	NOTES
	Green bank lodging:
		Observatory itself
		Bear Creek Lodge: 4.77 mi
		Chestnut Ridge Country Inn: 5.6 mi
		Cass Inn: 5.1 mi
		Boyer Motel & Restaurant: 4.4 mi
	Restrictions are delimited at whole mile numbers up to 10,
	so the best place is the Observatory, and the second best
	is a tie between Bear Creek Lodge and Boyer Motel
	The Sugar Grove station has closed and does not appear the
	best choice here.
