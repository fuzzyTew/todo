# planing is standardized to lose 0.5" from nominal dimension (for 2x's)
# so 2x4's are 1.5 " deep and we'll want plywood that's a little under
# a quarter inch to sheathe it.

# lumber likely 8' long

# plan for cuts: I'll probably want the floor to be full length so the studs may rest on it
# I'll want studs in the floor to walk on.  Two ends of the floor will be full size,
# and perpendicular studs will be decreased size to fill.
# short studs 'feel' sturdier because the air spaces are smaller, but this means more
# cuts to make more studs
# maybe I'll make the smaller airspace approah.

# so, floor length will be full with 2 studs
# floor width will have successive studs
# 4 corners, 2 corner studs for each corner
# ceiling as floor
# I should cut the inner straps from the tent so I can assemble this.
# They are no longer needed.
# studs are typically 16" on center, sometimes dropped to 12" on center
# I'll do 16" on center studs
