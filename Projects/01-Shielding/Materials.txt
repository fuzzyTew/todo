Non-shielding Materials
	Material		Melting Point C
	Corrugated Cardboard	258 (fire point, ambient)
	PETG			210
	Polystyrene		210
	Acrylic			160
	Bamboo			250-300 (ignition)
	
Plan for cheap flame-resistant material:
	Bamboo, 0.035 inches / 0.9 mm +-0.1mm from ponoko.com.  Also available thinner/thicker.
	$15.00 for 790 mm x 384 mm / 31.102 in x 15.118 in
	Large templates like this can be slightly warped.  181 mm x 181 mm / 7.126 in x 7.126 in warps less.

Plan for cheaper less flame-resistant structural material:
	Clear PETG, 1.0 mm (also 0.5 mm) +-0.1 mm
	$11.00 for 790 mm x 384 mm / 31.102 in x 15.118 in
	WARNING: description of petg implies low melting point, not high melting point.
	It bends a little.

average kerf decreases with thickness
hardboard/plywood have 0.2 mm for 3 mm thick
