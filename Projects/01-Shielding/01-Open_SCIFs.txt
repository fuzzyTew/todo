- Need public plans to produce emissions-secure SCIF

- People are very concerned regarding privacy nowadays, e.g. mobile phones

True digital security needs a SCIF at this time, due to e.g. Van Eck
Phreaking and backdoors in provider chips.

Solving these somewhat limited issues is doable at the moment, but
- There is no even-handed public discourse on specifically how
		Just a bunch of closed products with no details
- The available products do not cover everything.  It seems a complete
	SCIF is classified, although I should ask another company.
