I'd like to get some degree of handle on measuring the effectiveness of
shielded enclosures.

Goals:
	- Jankety approach: find a super-cheap way of estimating SE using an
	oscillating noise source
	- Pro approach: buy real tools and verify that professional measurements
	match my jankety measurements.
