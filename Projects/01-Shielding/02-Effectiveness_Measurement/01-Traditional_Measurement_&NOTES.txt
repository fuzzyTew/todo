	EUT: Equipment Under Test
	S/A: Spectrum Analyzer
	PRF: Pulse Repetition Frequency
	
	- Conducted and radiated emissions of the ambient with the EUT powered down must always be made prior to EMI testing.
	- Always ensure that equipment used to measure the test level has a CURRENT CALIBRATION and that a sanity check on the equipment is made.
		Sanity check: connect signal generator to input.

	- The user of absorber loads in a room may reduce hot spots.

	SPECTRUM ANALYZER 9.2.2
		- must prevent input compression and overload:
			search over frequency range of S/A to find maximum input level
			adjust input attenuator so displayed amplitude is at maximum or lower
			if displayed magnitude changes when attenuator is adjust, S/A is compressing (effective gain of front end changes from compression)
		- for maximum accuracy, use minimum span and minimum resolution
			- accuracy of displayed frequency function of resolution bandwidth and frequency span, typically +-3% of span and of resolution bandwidth
			- the narrower the resolution bandwidth, hte lower the noise level and the better the snr
		- resolution changes magnitude of noise, but does not change magnitude of narrowband signals, due to integration over bandwidth envelope
		- resolution affects width of display, width, shape and differentiability of signals, and sweep time, as it scales the frequency envelope
		- detection / compensation of compresion / overload in preamplifier section
		- due to need for fast sweep time, bandwidth spreads much wider than EMI receiver (gaussian rather than approaching rectangular filter)
		- low input impedance reduces contribution of common-mode noise BUT
		  low input impedance may load the signal when source impedance is high
		- input is DC coupled; decoupling capacitor must be used when measuring on high DC voltages
		- connects signal return to enclosure and thus to AC safety ground, which my drastically alter measured noise levels etc

	OSCILLOSCOPE 9.2.1
		- measurements must be converted to frequency domain
		- must test for common mode noise that may create differential across high-impedence 1-10 MOhm single-ended input
			connect probe ground clip to signal ground and point probe tip to same ground
			common-mode current flow on shield and center conductor may be measured
			voltage develops across impedance of shield due to shield current flow
			WARNING: some voltage measured may result from radiated pickup by loop of of probe and ground wire
			S/A impedance is 50-75 ohms and common mode contribution is much smaller
			- can use differential input plug-in to reject some common-mode noise
				want scope probe with differential located at probe tip
			- can use A - B mode or inverted A + B mode to measure differential voltage too
				connect ground clips together at probe but not to EUT ground or enclosure
				- measure common mode contribution by connecting both A and B to signal ground
					can adjust compensation trimmer capacitors to minimize
				- twist leads together to reduce radiated pickup
			- can measure noise current with current probe
		- must use preamplifier with current probe or antenna to be detectable with oscilloscope
		- may measure relative E field by attaching length of wire to probe tip
		- use 50 Ohm terminated input or 50 Ohm external termination with calibrated antennas
		- use as short a ground wire connection as feasible and locate close to probe
			to reduce inductance
		- low-inductance grounds present on attachments right next to signal preferred to ground wire
			alternatively, use FET transistor probe with low-input capacitance
		- connects signal return to enclosure and thus to AC safety ground, which my drastically alter measured noise levels etc
			(but this simulates input of equipment with same characteristic)
		- inductance of probe ground wire and input capacitance of probe form resonant circuit that changes waveshape or amplitude
			possibly causes ringing of a transient
			low-pass LC circuit may attenuate high-frequency signals
		- limited upper frequency response of average analog oscilloscope
		- erroneous measurements with high common-mode voltage like 120-220V
		- useful for single frequencies with low harmonic distortions when sensitivity is adequate
			for superimposed frequencies, use S/A
		- useful for transient noise in the time domain
		- typical probe may have bandwidth up to 2.5 GHz with < 1 pF input capacitance, +- 8 V dynamic range, +-12 V offset
		- some scopes have different impedance:
			<= 2.5 GHz bandwidth typically 1 MOhm and 50 Ohm
			Extremely high freq, typically << 1 Mohm and low max input voltage
			20 GHz 10 Gb/s scope for time-domain reflectometry has 50 Ohm input and max of +-2 V

	ERRORS
	9.1
		Errors greater than 30dB can be made during measurement, and when there is a discrepency, both theory and technique should be examined to find the error.
		It is easy for measurement equipment to affect results.
		Due to the difficulty of measurement, design should be based on theory, and measurement used to validate it.
