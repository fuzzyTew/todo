- [ ] Measurement:
  Made simple script but results are not what was expected.
  - [ ] Take a measurement of an emission peak when shielded and unshielded using a normal spectrogram.  Then debug a measurement approach until it can predict the same attenuation.
	-> orientation, placement, etc matter ... so possibly automate re-checking the comparison measurement to handle changes
  - [ ] Reuse noiscillate setup with new soapyRTLSDR changes (timing can be fixed).  Resolve misalignment bug and possible other bugs (some assumption of shifted average could be false?)
  - [ ] Build enclosable emitter / detector setup to measure actual shielded enclosure.
	Todo items in
	  - [ ] openemissions/shielding/effectiveness-measurement/noiscillate-data/test.cpp
      	Current work with more todo in
	  - [ ] ?-?-*.cpp
  - [ ] Verify technique for discerning single emitter profile by trying with varying presence of background noise
  - [ ] Verify technique for discerning S.E. by comparing with conventional equipment

- [ ] Construction:
	- [X] lasercutting extension is at https://github.com/execuc/LCInterlocking.git
	- [ ] build living hinges square for peelable door
	- [ ] produce design for interlocking box
	- [ ] cut hole in interlocking box to place door on outside against lip all around
	- [ ] export and order
	- [ ] construct, but not with smallest gauge foil due to experience of small rips
Ordered some copper foil, and some thin solder to test soldering the copper foil.
I could even just put the foil on cardboard or something.
Plan to make a completely sealed enclosure and verify effectiveness of 2 thicknesses of foil.
Would like to videotape construction of enclosure and testing, but note it is easy to repeat testing.
