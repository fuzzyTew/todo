I started using my existing routine script, made a brushing.routine .
It doesn't tell me how much nicotine I should have, process the responses I give, or have a timer, all of which could be helpful.

Scripts I have:
	- tasks: picks random things, apparently; I think there's only 1 of these?
	- routine: goes through a list, provides for start and end times, allows to abort/skip/already
	- meds: goes through a list, only does one time, allows for notes
	- exercise: has a library of functions, and then special scripts for each task.  has a timer, allows media programs
	  does not record automatically

I guess I'll need a new script.
A concern is integrating with a daily schedule.
Another concern is my difficulty thinking.  Clarity and simplicity are helpful.
