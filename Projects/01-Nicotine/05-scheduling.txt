I started using my existing routine script, made a brushing.routine .
It doesn't tell me how much nicotine I should have, process the responses I give, or have a timer, all of which could be helpful.

Scripts I have:
	- tasks: picks random things, apparently; I think there's only 1 of these?
	- routine: goes through a list, provides for start and end times, allows to abort/skip/already
	- meds: goes through a list, only does one time, allows for notes
	- exercise: has a library of functions, and then special scripts for each task.  has a timer, allows media programs
	  does not record automatically

I guess I'll need a new script.
A concern is integrating with a daily schedule.
Another concern is my difficulty thinking.  Clarity and simplicity are helpful.
	-> idea: advanced academic textbook quizes

Concerns:
- brushing's a little harder at night, and I do one of the brushes without N2 ...
	- i'm thinking it's just because it's at night.  it'll happen.
- I'm doing awareness / nvc a lot throughout the day
	- it's okay for now ... they really help you i think
- some irritation at idea of work being interrupted by awareness / nvc
	- there's some meaning there; work goes well ongoing.  i tihnk it'll be okay though
- how to combine tasks with n2 dose? will it have effectiveness?
	--> ongoing. probably will have effectiveness, have to way failures vs intensity.  maybe drop as low as doesnt increase failures much.
	-> concept: fell off wagon.  drop dose to 'low' level: max with no failures
	-> concept: achieved rare goal: raise dose to 'high' level ONCE
	-> concept: contact behaviorist to consult
