My current behavior is to go through my inbox, deal with each paper one at a time, and place it in my paper file.
My plane is to scan everything in from my paper file.

Since I'm scanning everything, I can forget about the paper file.
I should hire somebody to scan my papers and books.  Gwyn could do this as a care person.

I'll want to spend my time comprehending my papers and set them to be scanned in.
I'll want to date and label things as best I can.
- [ ] get a scanner working
	-> riley could help

But I'll want to review all my behaviors and pick things that are higher priority.

- [ ] REVIEW ALL BEHAVIORS AND PICK PRIORITIES
