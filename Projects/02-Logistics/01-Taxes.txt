	Turns out I had a net loss in 2018, actually larger than my income of 2017.

	I filed taxes for 2017 using turbotax but did not pay them.
	I think they were around $20,000 .
	I currently have around $6,000 and make around $1,000 a month.
	I'll need a payment plan.
	Taxes for 2018 are coming up.
	I have a _lot_ of taxable cryptocurrency trades, hundreds or thousands.
	I received a document in the mail regarding taxes and insurance.
	Gwyn referred me to a local woman who can do taxes, but she will still likely expect me to do some work.

	- [ ] discern what is needed for last year's taxes
		Keep in mind I can likely pay my taxes but only on an installment basis.
