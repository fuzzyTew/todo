	The tool I was using for tracking gains/losses was bitcoin.tax .  It costs money but appears to do

	Some of the numbers are inaccurate because I haven't imported all of my exchanges.

	I filed taxes for 2017 using turbotax but did not pay them.
	I think they were around $20,000 .
	I currently have around $6,000 and make around $1,000 a month.
	I'll need a payment plan.
	Taxes for 2018 are coming up.
	I have a _lot_ of taxable cryptocurrency trades, hundreds or thousands.
	I received a document in the mail regarding taxes and insurance.
	In 2018, I used a service that computed my cryptocurrency gains and losses.

		Keep in mind I can likely pay my taxes but only on an installment basis.
