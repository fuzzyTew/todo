- [ ] Measurement:
  Made simple script but results are not what was expected.
  - [ ] Take notes on electromagnetic compatibility / shielding resource material and plan correct way to measure S.E. to compare with crafted way.
  	- [ ] Notes on traditional measurement methods in 01-Traditional_Measurement.txt
  - [ ] Reuse noiscillate setup with new soapyRTLSDR changes (timing can be fixed).  Resolve misalignment bug and possible other bugs (some assumption of shifted average could be false?)
  - [ ] Build enclosable emitter / detector setup to measure actual shielded enclosure.
	Todo items in
	  - [ ] openemissions/shielding/effectiveness-measurement/noiscillate-data/test.cpp
      	Current work with more todo in
	  - [ ] ?-?-*.cpp
  - [ ] Verify technique for discerning single emitter profile by trying with varying presence of background noise
  - [ ] Verify technique for discerning S.E. by comparing with conventional equipment

- [ ] Construction:
Ordered some copper foil, and some thin solder to test soldering the copper foil.
I could even just put the foil on cardboard or something.
Plan to make a completely sealed enclosure and verify effectiveness of 2 thicknesses of foil.
Would like to videotape construction of enclosure and testing, but note it is easy to repeat testing.
