- [ ] Measurement:
Working on a set of scripts to acquire noise profiles without oscillation and measure S.E. from 4 measured histograms.
Todo items in
  - [ ] openemissions/shielding/effectiveness-measurement/noiscillate-data/test.cpp
      Current work with more todo in
      - [ ] 1-2-gen-diff-hist.cpp

- [ ] Construction:
Ordered some copper foil, and some thin solder to test soldering the copper foil.
I could even just put the foil on cardboard or something.
Plan to make a completely sealed enclosure and verify effectiveness of 2 thicknesses of foil.
Would like to videotape construction of enclosure and testing, but note it is easy to repeat testing.
