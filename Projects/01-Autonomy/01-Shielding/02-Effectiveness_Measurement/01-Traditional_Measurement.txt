	EUT: Equipment Under Test
	
	- Conducted and radiated emissions of the ambient with the EUT powered down must always be made prior to EMI testing.
	- Always ensure that equipment used to measure the test level has a CURRENT CALIBRATION and that a sanity check on the equipment is made.
		Sanity check: connect signal generator to input.

	ERRORS
	9.1
		Errors greater than 30dB can be made during measurement, and when there is a discrepency, both theory and technique should be examined to find the error.
		It is easy for measurement equipment to affect results.
		Due to the difficulty of measurement, design should be based on theory, and measurement used to validate it.
