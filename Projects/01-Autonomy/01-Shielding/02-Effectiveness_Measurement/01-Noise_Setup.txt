The noise source is wired up to broadcast at a configurable frequency.

The noise can be isolated as a spike at its broadcast frequency if the absolute magnitude is taken of IQ data prior to performing the FFT.

The code for running the noise on a raspberry pi is in the openemissions repository.  I'd like to upgrade it to use the gpio server, so the same
pi can be used for other tasks too.

[ ] I still need to make my noise generator a 'permanent setup' -- right now it's hanging off a breadboard.  The pi runs at 5V aned the noise generator at 12V, so a component is needed to convert power.

[ ] I'd like to try adjusting the power provided to the noise generator and seeing how the recorded magnitude changes.  This will help me verify I am measuring the power correctly.

[ ] Obviously the measurement technique should be compared to pro methods.

-- old:

I have a 12V unbranded "noise source" from ebay.
The RF output matches the adapters I have for the ham-it-up upconverter.

I'll need to power it, test it, and oscillate it.
- screwdriver & tools to rig wires
- controller to manage (arduino) (also order some more controllers, a couple good arduinos and a couple good rasperry pis)

I'll add these tools to what to do outside of the shelter, then work on the receiving end.
