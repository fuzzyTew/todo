I tried to organize this file a bit, and found that some of the items might belong elsewhere.
When I'm working on the trailer, I want to build the walls, because that's where the work
needs to happen.  But the trailer also needs door design, haven phone fixed, and exterior
work.  Phone fixing could go among other tasks that involve repairing systems around a
laptop.  When aluminum plates arrive, learning to weld them would belong in my welding
practice time.  I guess now that I have "subject time blocks" it complicates things.
