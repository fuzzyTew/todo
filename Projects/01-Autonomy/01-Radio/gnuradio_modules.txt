most useful appear:
multi-rtl: combines rtl-sdr's to increase bandwidth.  includes hw instructions in repo
		-> author requests tag feature in osmocom_source to detect overflows which mean resync needed ;p
		-> cross-correlates at same freq to sync, then retunes keeping sync (tuning doesn't produce delay)
		-> NOTE: relies on stream not having gaps or resync could be needed!
gr-theano: has hw-accelerated fft, and generic framework for hardware-accelerated blocks
gr-inspector: some automatic signal detection, analysis and tools
gr-doa: uses usrp phase syncronization to identify direction of source
gr-grnet: lighter weight tcp/udp blocks
gr-display: image and text output blocks
gr-filerepeater: additional file source
gr-radar: centralized radar toolbox, much work, some activity, appears was gsoc project
