  Blue popped out of my head.
    green ... ... purple grey orange
  Should schedule transdermals and see piercer to get wires replaced.

  A number of the leads are rejecting.
  The purple one over my left eye has rejected completely.
  The green one over the left top of my head has nearly rejected.  It was plugged into AGND, so wasn't doing anything anyway!
  My understand is the bottom SRB pin is SRB2, which is by default used as reference (or ground) relative to the bottom row of N pins.
  Grey: above right eyeball.  Seems to be connected well.
  Orange: back left of head.  Also seems a little loose.
  The dermal in the back right of my head with no wires connected seems to be staying fine.

  New arrangement:
    AGND BIAS ... N2    N1     SRB
              ... green orange grey

2018-03-26: two leads
  Green has popped out of the left middle of my scalp.
  Just recording orange (back left) relative to grey (front right)
