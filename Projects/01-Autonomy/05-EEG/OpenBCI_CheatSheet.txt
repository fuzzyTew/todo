- bottom pins are N inputs, top pins are P inputs
- bottom N inputs are by default in reference to SRB2, the bottom SRB pin
    inputs can be selectively removed from this reference, and then top (P) pin is used as reference

SRB (REF for differential amplifier) can be WHITE
BIAS (noise cancelling GND) can be BLACK

OpenBCI uses an ADS1299 which documents these pins (theoretically) http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ads1299.pdf
  The pin uses and register settings are documented on pages 39-47
