This folder features all things EEG: 
- finding a way to monitor brainwaves 24/7. 
- mirodermal piercing
- permanent, realtime storage of data
- analysis of data analysis (includes subprojects)
- creating mobile applications that support this system (ie create an app on karl's phone where he can press a button when something happens, or where it can ask a question and he can reply)
- feedback (getting the system to tell Karl what is going on, and possibly training him to have different experiences)
- correlation and integration (combinging data with data from other systems in order to increase knowledge)
- finding a way to make it opensource so that others can also do this.
- publicity / Outreach (so that it can support others who also have a need for EEG). 
- integrating this work with existing efforts, and sharing new tools we create.
