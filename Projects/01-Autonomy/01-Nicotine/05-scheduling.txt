I started using my existing routine script, made a brushing.routine .
It doesn't tell me how much nicotine I should have, process the responses I give, or have a timer, all of which could be helpful.

Scripts I have:
	- tasks: picks random things, apparently; I think there's only 1 of these?
	- routine: goes through a list, provides for start and end times, allows to abort/skip/already
	- meds: goes through a list, only does one time, allows for notes
	- exercise: has a library of functions, and then special scripts for each task.  has a timer, allows media programs
	  does not record automatically

I guess I'll need a new script.
A concern is integrating with a daily schedule.
Another concern is my difficulty thinking.  Clarity and simplicity are helpful.
	-> idea: advanced academic textbook quizes

Concerns:
- brushing's a little harder at night, and I do one of the brushes without N2 ...
	- i'm thinking it's just because it's at night.  it'll happen.
- I'm doing awareness / nvc a lot throughout the day
	- it's okay for now ... they really help you i think
- some irritation at idea of work being interrupted by awareness / nvc
	- there's some meaning there; work goes well ongoing.  i tihnk it'll be okay though
- how to combine tasks with n2 dose? will it have effectiveness?
	--> ongoing. probably will have effectiveness, have to way failures vs intensity.  maybe drop as low as doesnt increase failures much.
	-> concept: fell off wagon.  drop dose to 'low' level: max with no failures
	-> concept: achieved rare goal: raise dose to 'high' level ONCE
	-> concept: contact behaviorist to consult

New script.
	Language?
		-> python: hard to debug, really
		-> node: also hard to debug
			large library set
		-> c/c++: small library set, more verbose, but more experience using
			string parsing hard
		-> shell: awkward
		-> java: minimal experience, historical dislike for memory footprint
		-> rust: minimal experience, but want to learn
		-> other new languages
		-> old languages i don't know or aren't used much

		Probably Python or C++: python is easier to debug than node
			python has more libraries than c++
		List requirements to finish picking language.
	Requirements?
		- time my behavior
		- ask yes/no questions if i subjectively met a goal
		- control n2 output, which is likely a behavior 
		- display a schedule and allow adjustment / priorities / or something (modular ways to adjuts schedule)
		- provide for randomly chosen tasks
		- provide for ensuring just enough time spent on a goal that the work it is addressing is, on average, shrinking (where appropriate)
		- provide for categories that can be treated with their own training data e.g. doing task alone vs with others around, or doing when happy vs doing when depressed

		- adjust behavior from sensors, e.g. video, network, keylog

Request: let's track our daily task time, right now.  I just had a pretty brief work window and I want to spend more time accomplishing my goals.
	-> I'm thinking I'll start making this system, in C++ (to ease debugging) with a goal of immediately using it to track time.
		time tracking concepts:
		- prompt to start random activities?
		- integrate with csv files
		- display time spent on activity, downtime, and ratios: see time tracking scripts
		- report, starting activity now
			- success % on finish
			- interruption
		- long-running system service (just a daemon process)
		- provide for future multi-device use
===> OOPS! ttrack already does this ;p <===
