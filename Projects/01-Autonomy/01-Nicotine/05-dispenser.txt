goal 1: secure box that cannot be disassembled reasonably and dispenses nicotine
	only when some computer-verifiable condition has been met
goal 2: device can control the quantity of nicotine precisely

further goals:
	- prevent removal of substance from body?
	- control quantity of nicotine precisely
	- concocts nicotine mixture automatically

I set up a soap dispenser and measured it.
I found it took 15 of the largest squirts to fill my canning jar to the 100 mL mark.
I found it took 17 of the largest squirts to reach the next 200 mL mark.
I'm assuming my canning jar has the first mark too low due to the round shape at the bottom.
This would make each squirt at most about 100/17 mL or around 5.88 mL.
I don't want to take more than 1mg of nicotine at a time, so I'll want to put 32 mg in a solution
that fills my canning jar to the 200 mL line.  That's 16 2mg lozenges, or 8 4mg lozenges.

Most of the fluid went off my toothbrush.  Trying lower does.
At smallest does,
It took 37 squirts to reach a different jar's 100 mL mark.
It took 39 more squires to reach its next 200 mL mark.
It still mostly runs off the toothbrush!
Maybe I can use actual toothpate, or increase the thickness somehow.
1 mg / squirt: 37 mg to 100 mL.  Try 38.

Dispenser got clogged when viscosity was high enough to stay on brush.
Options: - increase viscosity after dispensing, by e.g. mixing with toothpaste
	 - pursue drill bit inside powder approach, to push powder out of box in controlled manner
	 => mix with thickening powder after dispensing to increase viscosity for brushing

Got my soap dispenser in mail.  Has a large circuit board that powers pump, controlled by button.

Attempt number one will be to wire an arduino to the power for the device, and to control the button.
The button controls volume.  Toggling it affects quantity and power.

Setting up dispenser again with thickening plan.  I have graduated cylinders to measure volume correctly.
I found that the volume dispensed depends on the volume loaded, with the amount decreasing as the pressure decreases.

Data for smallest dispensing unit is in dispensertests.txt .
I measured dispensing with the body filled amounts ranging from 30 mL to 140 mL.
I found the dispensed amount to range from 0.3 mL to 1.2 mL.
It dispenses almost nothing when first starting up.  I imagine it needs to fill the tube.
The dispensed amount appears to be roughly proportional to the amount filled.
(Average Small Dispense) = 0.597035 mL + 0.00164173 * (Volume Filled)
but it can vary widely.

I'm thinking I'll assume an average dispensed amount of 0.7612 mL, which is the approximate average amount when filled to 100 mL.

I guess I'll want a concentration of 1 mg at 0.7612 mL.
That's about
262.74 mg in 200 mL
131.37 mg in 100 mL
65.685 mg in  50 mL

Maybe I'll try putting 64 mg in 50 mL, giving a goal dosage of 0.974336 mL / dispense.

Okay, I'm planning to write a program to track the dispensing.
Likely use ROOT & TFile.  I'll need to store how much volume is in the dispenser, and update it when dispensing happens.
Then it can predict the size of the dose, and later control how many doses etc.

== goal 1 ==
probably a cage or metal box with an opening for power & networking, and a door.
door must be openable from inside by powered device
device is likely a single board computer, raspberry pi

raspberry pi will run off of power, plug into network (similar to camera project)
and dispense N2.

: monologue 1
	How will device dispense n2?  opening a door is reasonable ... will need
some engineering to design dispensing.
Could have a hopper with a shutter on it.  How determine that n2 dispensed by
hopper in proper amount?
	-> could guess it based on shutter timing =/
	-> this could work with powder too; clumping could be an issue, but could
	   have a dessicant that's replaceable
There's a great answer to this question at https://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/1259/how-to-measure-and-dispense-a-finite-amount-of-powder-or-liquid/1261#1261
which has a short url of https://robotics.stackexchange.com/a/1261

I'm thinking a box with a round hole at the bottom, with an augur bit that pushes things through the hole ...
Actually, after reading how much more precise liquid dosing can be, I'm thinking
hacking up a soap dispenser would be the way to go.  This is cheap and simple.
Will probably want a pipe to feed liquid into dispenser, with a valve on it to
keep it from drying out.
Sounds simple and doable.

# monologue
I'll need a metric to rank the VALUE of DEVELOPING and MAINTAINING different habits
I'll also need a metric to judge the EFFECTIVENESS of different approaches to development and maintainence
Propose adding numbers to different current habits, and possible new habits
	some of these numbers could relate to the goal the habits pursue, and their effectiveness in pursuit of that goal
