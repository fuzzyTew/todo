Questions:
	- [ ][X] What is needed to detect accientally held devices?
			I asked David about interferenc detection, but I can kind of infer that this would be done with a spectrum analyzer in a quiet environment.
	- [ ][X] How can I learn more?
			Some astronomers gave me some references of a wide variety, and a link to the radio astronomy hobby groups that has a ton of detail.
			The tour guides spout information and one can take the tours freely.
			David is available for email questions, and I asked him about recommended education programs.
			I'm trying to get involved in internships and classes, which seem like the way to go.
			It would be useful to form a connection with a local researcher etc, help out with their work or something to get involved.  I could reach out individually to see if this available on a more informal basis.
			The site seems open to people coming and going, it doesn't seem locked down.
	- [ ][X] Could you aim scope at object to figure out molecules in it?
			I asked David through what emissions process interstellar molecules were detected.  If his answer is clear it may answer this, or it may be uncertain if that would work terrestrially.
			I saw something on the board regarding H2CO spectrum, mentioning wavenumber/cm^-1 ...
	- [ ] Could you pick up man-made signals from the past, reflected back off an interstellar object?
	- [ ] Ask Breakthrough Listen workers for access to this year's data
	- [ ] Review other researchers' projects: most are said to provide access to data, and can always be asked
	- [ ] Is scope sensitive enough to pick up muscle contractions?  CNS emissions?
			I'm expecting so.
	- [ ] Do research if scope is sensitive enough to pick up muscle contractions, and propose a research project to detect them.
			-> may involve coming up with a shared purpose for doing so; perhaps detecting missing persons, or counting wildlife for ecological studies
	- [ ] How does a radio telescope interferometer work?
			I understand that it uses many small, distant telescopes to create the receiving equivalent in some manner of a telescope equal in size to their distance.
		- [ ] VLBI Very Long Baseline Inerferometry, uses two distant scopes
	- [ ] What other kinds of radio telescope arrays are there?
	- [ ] Are there ways interested people could spend time around researchers and get to know there work?
	- [ ] Are there any options for internship or mentoring if not involved in a degree program?
		-> perhaps pursue applying for internship first.  
	- [ ] What construction is used to make use of array receivers when a parabolic dish would focus to a single point?
		-> I think high tech tour answers this question; just need to pay more attention.

Deduce from notes:
	- [ ] What is an equatorial mount?

QUIET ZONE LEGISLATION
	- 1956 10 mi zone under WV Radio Astronomy Zoning Act
		surveiled and enforced by vehicle
	- 1958 NRQZ by FCC, 13k mi^2
	- GBO on-site, microwave etc devices forbidden

SHIELDING
	- copper mesh is used for basic faraday cage
	- signals detected in demo with spectrum analyzer
	- exhibit room is "faraday" cage by tour guide, upon inspection is a more advanced shielded room produced by universal shielding with anechoic absorbers on entryway

ARRAYS
	- interferometer
	- other?
	some have arrays in their pickups

MOUNT/AIM SYSTEMS
	- equatorial
	- other?

	- GBT: 485 ft
	- 300' 1961
	- many built
	- 2700 acre site purchased 1957

CONSTRUCTION EXAMPLES:
	- 1/8" paraboloid aluminum reflector focuses parallel wave onto point receiver

GBO INVOLVEMENT
	- volunteered at Pierce's Store, where I sold to custmoers, performed inventory, and reverse engineered an electronic scale to interconnect it with modern checkout software
		- [ ] yrs? perhaps supervisor could be good reference (Sally)
	- farm intern at spring lake ranch
	- [ ] app to fill application out
	- truly care about every person I meet
	- experience in electronics, CS
	- some college, EE, CS, Math, Botany

Answers
	- [X] Does air strip commms interfere with telescope?
			On-site airstrip does not appear to be used.
			Nearby airstrip is in arborvale and appears private and coordinated with scope.
	- [X] How to download scope recordings?
		David e-mailed me link to Breakthrough Listen data.  Employees have offered to 
	- [X] Does the pickup have an array of sensors like a camera?
		Some have a handful of sensors, but mostly images are made by slowly changing the aim.
