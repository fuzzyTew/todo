- gnuradio uses tag streams / stream tags for data synchronous with samples
- gnuradio uses messages for asynchronous data

We'll want to make sure both of these are implemented for the interfaces we use.
This appears to be done for uhd/usrp

- there are also tagged stream bocks; tags are use to identify packet boundaries
  these appear to just be blocks that take special stream tags, but seem to have
  innate differences too

- gnuradio uses VOLK for vectorization
