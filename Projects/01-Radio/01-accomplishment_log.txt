Backend: build supports for robust development environment based on gnuradio
Frontend: finish software to profile emitter and detect it, only working reasonably hard to detect it given profile

	ACCOMPLISHMENT!  I settled onto the profile/detection approach in a more laid-out way.
	I want to remember that if I get caught in the indecision of sensitivity vs complexity again, that I have chosen this solution.

	Next: pick an approach to profile.  Detection will just be simple

	SO MANY ACCOMPLISHMENTS!
	I picked an approach to profile and detect.  Left to handle:
		- multiple sessions could have different PPM
		- wideband measurement / tuning
	I got basic profiler code working.  Just need to store to file and possibly consider PPM.
	I reached out on crypto lists and found a tscm list !!!! mirimir says he has done similar work !!
	
	
FRONTEND: - [X] pick an approach to profiling (perhaps FFT?) (note it is LOUDER THAN ALL BACKGROUND NOISE)
BACKEND: - [ ] do a task from gr-osmosdr/TASKS.txt
FRONTEND: - [ ] store profile to file (and make profiling binary?)
FRONTEND: - [ ] plan precisely how to handle PPM
FRONTEND: - [ ] implement detector based on integrating exact known period (can detect when accuracy may be exhausted by phase drift?)
FRONTEND: - [ ] when working, close up backend here for now.  it was only if frontend was a dead end.
