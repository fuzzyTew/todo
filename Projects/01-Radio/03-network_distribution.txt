I think GnuRadio can do network distribution using 'socket pdu' and 'tcp server sink' although I haven't tried this.

SoapyRemote:
  Each stream is specific to one client, and devices in general don't allow more than one stream on a single channel.
  Implementing multiple clients reading from the same stream means solving the problem of who defines the buffer format and which channels get bundled into streams.
  A quick solution might be to provide a way for read-only clients to enumerate streams opened by read-write clients, and to block while waiting for a stream to be opened
    by a read-write client.

Pothos:
  Pothos has a 'network' block but it would need to be modified to distribute to multiple clients.  It assumes exactly one client.
  Alternatively, the network block could be multiply instantiated by the application.

GnuRadio:
  GnuRadio may be able to do this with the 'socket pdu' and 'tcp server sink' blocks.

  GnuRadio appears to have a 'ControlPort' feature that seems partially intended to provide this, although I'm unsure if it will allow connection to further processing blocks.
  The 'tune' function is disabled in the example, stating it is unsupported, whereas 'tune' is the functionality I am looking to use.
