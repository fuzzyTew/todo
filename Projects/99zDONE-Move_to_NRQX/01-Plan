Settle for the near future in West Virginia or Virginia near a highly regulated area of the National Radio Quiet Zone.

PLAN:
Leave on June 26.  Move tent to box truck and live in there until I leave.
		
- [ ] synchronize katie's desires below and e-mail thread regarding concerns
	-> katie's using the team to-do list sheet
- [ ] Plan an addition to the frame for air ventilation
	- right-angles are:
		width: 9.5" to block inside, 10.25" to fit around it
		height: 3.25" to block inside, 4.5" to fit around it
		gap at inside of right-angle is 1"
		thinking vertical studs to put weight on the frame right
		horizontal cross-beams can be placed between them just to protect
			from scraping tent
		concept:
			- cross-beams overlapping vertical studs could hold right-angles
			in place
			- will need sides to extend back past depth to hold force of
			tent from crushing vent
			- propose another set of studs set back from front studs
			- 'kick' and 'top' plates to support them, along with horizontals
			  near vent
			might want 'inner' and 'outer' studs, 'outer' to hold vertical
			length of vent, 'inner' to protect tent
			given it's only 4.5 inches deep I could just use a row of studs
			to hold it, could be quite strong
			probably would want crossbeams to hold them in place
			doesn't really seem necessary .... maybe triangles would be better
			if i'm concerned
			- home depot might do an angled cut to make triangles
			  imagine 30 or 45 degrees would be best, probbly not crucial tho
			  the right angle is square, good for 45, but it will have
			  a vertical length rising from it
			- note there is another right angle at top of vertical length.
			- I should pobbly but horizontals at the back so that pressure
			  at middle is absorbed by wood... may not really matter
			I think the 'minimal wood' approach would be vertical studs and
			  feet that project from them.  The feet could be made strong
			  by connecting their ends all together and adding a diagonal
			
			8 vertical studs to go around near tent (4 for tent corners,
			  just affix them to the wall, 4 for around vertical)
			- [X] 8x -> 81.0"
			~6 horizontals for vents to rest in and spread verticals properly
			   in back with no middle stud
			-> 20.5" sliding between verticals
			3 small verticals to protect between vent mouth and tent
			-> 3.5"
			3 long depth lengths on top to protect tent
			- [X] 3x -> 70 3/4 " tent depth
			1 extra horizontal to hold front of frame before tent is erected
			-> probably want to cut this to the actual truck width in place
			- [X] -> should be under 92.5 "
			12 short depth lengths to support weight of tent and protect vent
			-> 2"
		
- [ ] Build frame and move into truck
- [ ] do 1 outer tent task

- [ ] Spend remaining time prior to deadline finishing up things that
      are not necessities.
- [ ] Contact Green Bank Observatory and see if I could pay them to host me even though I am not an astronomer.
- [ ] Review Bear Creek Lodge and Boyer Motel as potential places to stay.

= Katie's Desires =
	- [ ] Infectious Diseases
		^-- big one, hits her heart
		Requests stay for 6 months from start of antibiotics, until
		start of immunotherapy
		Would like to see me having had support of 6 mo herxing and
		regularly taking antibiotics before going.
		Says Dr Boubolis says should see notable improvement given
		that time; better chance of success on my own: improved
		clarity of mind and energy.
		Expects I stop treatment if I go to WV.
		- [ ] certain plan to stay on antibiotics regimen
		- [ ] some level of support available if undergoing worse herxing
	- [ ] My mom (as katie is a mom)
		Parents really seem to want kids close.  Kids need freedom
		to live on their own, but it hits her heart.
		What if mom is dying soon?  We don't know.  The fear exists
		but we generally don't think she is.
		(that's terrifying regardless, for me)
		Katie says I could visit parents during immunotherapy visits!

- [X] do adventure, then return

- [X] go to HW store
	-> first look for ventilation stuff, find depth
	-> subtract depth from total height
	- [X] decide to either use decrased height
	      and perhaps get ventilation
	-     or bust hole and get cutoff wheel and grinder
	- [ ] get these things

	- [X] rerun script with height and get lumber
	- [X] cut lumber to lengths and sizes
		-> note store may do this faster than you
			they won't be as precise ... but it'll be ok
- [X] Email Bill & Katie and send phone text from iphone
	-> can't find text, perhaps overwritten by newer texts
- [X] measure height of back of truck where tent will go
	-> 7' 0.5" tallish
	-> .5' bump at back corners
	-> rails leave 5' 1.5" at back
	-> door does not go back as far as rails and leave 7' 6" at back
	-> can go farther forward, door will just not raise all the way
	-> width should lose 1.75" for rails methinks
- [X] check bank balance be sure I can afford lumber (>$3k in bank is fine)
- [X] look for nearby source for lumber
	-> there are a lot of nearby lumber stores but home depot is the
	only place open after 5 on a sunday
- [X] if possible enumerate what they have for plywood to find
	      something just under 0.25"
	-> cheap Ash Harboard Tempered Panel 1/8 in
		$7.12 for 4x8
	Note that the thicker the heavier.  I should probably use 1/8 in
	for all but floor.
- [X] if possible see what they have for ventilation stuff and review choice of cutting vs air-over-top
	-> h-d has rectangular ducts that are 3.25 in tall
- [X] find measurements of truck and of tent
	I'm going to define a coordinate system for the truck.
	Z is up
	X is right and left
	Y is front and back
	(right, front, up)
	truck: 14' 7/8" long
	       7' 8" wide grows .5" wider at back
	       6' 8 5/8" tall to door frame, 6' 9" tall to door
	       door opening follows curve made by 15" segments hypotenuss at top
	tent outer:
		3 M wide
		2 M deep
		2.3 M tall
	tent inner:
		2.9 M wide
		1.9 M deep
		2.25 M tall (floor has no air space)
- [X] test tent frame dimensions
- [X] determine how to account for airflow.  could bust hole in front of truck box,
      or could direct air over top of tent
	-> leaning towards air over top
- [X] Plan outside tent behavior
- [X] put clothes on
- [X] Come up with a deadline to go.
- [X] Green Bank Observatory itself offers lodging for astronomers.  It's around $80/night.
- [X] I contact one provider of mobile satellite service.  They seemed unfamiliar with the NRQZ, but stated their device was a transmitter and hence would not be allowed in Green Bank.  Elsewhere it is stated that highly directional transmitters may be okay.
- [X] Look into the most highly-regulated hotel in the area.  I could stay there until I can get land.
	- Green Bank Observatory
	- Bear Creek Lodge
	- Boyer Motel
	NOTES
	Green bank lodging:
		Observatory itself
		Bear Creek Lodge: 4.77 mi
		Chestnut Ridge Country Inn: 5.6 mi
		Cass Inn: 5.1 mi
		Boyer Motel & Restaurant: 4.4 mi
	Restrictions are delimited at whole mile numbers up to 10,
	so the best place is the Observatory, and the second best
	is a tie between Bear Creek Lodge and Boyer Motel
	The Sugar Grove station has closed and does not appear the
	best choice here.
