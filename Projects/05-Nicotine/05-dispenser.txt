goal 1: secure box that cannot be disassembled reasonably and dispenses nicotine
	only when some computer-verifiable condition has been met

goal 2: device can control the quantity of nicotine precisely


== goal 1 ==
probably a cage or metal box with an opening for power & networking, and a door.
door must be openable from inside by powered device
device is likely a single board computer, raspberry pi

raspberry pi will run off of power, plug into network (similar to camera project)
and dispense N2.

: monologue 1
	How will device dispense n2?  opening a door is reasonable ... will need
some engineering to design dispensing.
Could have a hopper with a shutter on it.  How determine that n2 dispensed by
hopper in proper amount?
	-> could guess it based on shutter timing =/
	-> this could work with powder too; clumping could be an issue, but could
	   have a dessicant that's replaceable
There's a great answer to this question at https://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/1259/how-to-measure-and-dispense-a-finite-amount-of-powder-or-liquid/1261#1261
which has a short url of https://robotics.stackexchange.com/a/1261

I'm thinking a box with a round hole at the bottom, with an augur bit that pushes things through the hole ...
Actually, after reading how much more precise liquid dosing can be, I'm thinking
hacking up a soap dispenser would be the way to go.  This is cheap and simple.
Will probably want a pipe to feed liquid into dispenser, with a valve on it to
keep it from drying out.
Sounds simple and doable.
