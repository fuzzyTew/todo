idea of: finding paper describing this metric
    sbx137.pdf is from https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/44/5/1035/4662837
    "Robust Structural Imaging Signature of Schizophrenia

idea of: eeg would provide more real time feedback.  any research papers around eeg and metrics of brain function, could probably inform that.

idea of: ask researcher if there is a way to measure the grey matter loss, maybe some other discipline of research?
    we sent an email to christos@rad.upenn.edu asking a question regarding grey matter loss.  They are likely still available to process imagery if we ask.


note: we have mri and eeg data already.
