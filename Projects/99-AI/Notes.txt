MOSES:
	implements arbitrary function regression, with intelligence
	this part has no sense of time or order
	internals may roughly implement brainstorming-on-task.

	it also has support for interactive agents.  this appears poorly documented,
	and not robust.
	
	exemplars: appear to represent goals and plans
	knobs: appear to represent habits and considerations
	deme: actual plan
		^-- appears to be used also as start of intermediary steps
		    to simplify into new exemplars and knobs
		    using reduction/normalization
		    Ideal form is considered the smallest.
