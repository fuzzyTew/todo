I'm accessing my OpenBCI while swishing my nicotine toothpaste.

I found two; there are more.

- [ ] Label it
- [ ] Try it out following official instructions
- [ ] Try removing the hot glue?
- [ ] If glue is removable and still does not work, prepare to mail to Riley
- [ ] Prepare a message to support regarding any issues
- [ ] Try to debug it by hand
- [ ] Measure the impedance of a resistor

- [ ] Find a nearby piercer
- [ ] Contact them and ask:
    - Do they do microdermals?
    - Do they know about figure-8 microdermals?  I've heard they don't come out -- does that mean they can't be removed easily, or does it mean they don't reject?
    - If they don't reject, would they place them in me?
    - Do they know who the nearest 3d body modifier is?
- [ ]
    - If microdermal success, get one and measure impedance; add tasks here
    - If microdermal failure, contact body modifier and continue transdermal pursuit.  Inform Brian for politeness.

- [ ] Ask at post office how to get a passport

- [ ] Find someone out of country to place a device on my brain to record it.  This has been done for others.

- [ ] Contact PCP and find the nearest neurologist




Next:
- [X] label

- [ ] add post office request to town todo
- [ ] add telescope planning to town todo.  note that it is valuable to try even if I forgot my toothpaste (I can also put toothpaste in bag)
