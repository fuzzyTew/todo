Notes:
	Transdermals are M1.6 internal threads.
	Steve Haworth is the guy to contact to move up to subdermals.
	Could get medical implant in another country.
	Samppa would like to be updated how my project goes.
	I have 3 pics on my phone notes from Samppa but have only reviewed 2
		on blackberry priv

I'm measuring the impedance of my electrodes before continuing.

- [ ] determine impedance of ear dermals
- [ ] determine conductivity of transdermal shaft, base, and hole
	- [ ] DC
	- [ ] 32 HZ
- [ ] ream hole wider to remove coating
	- [ ] prep to do this; find a tool and bit
		-> probably want a fine polish to reduce microscopic cracking
	- [ ] if waiting, move on to next larger step
	- [ ] do it
	- [ ] measure impedance of hole with coating removed
	- [ ] document steps
- [ ] contact brian
	- [ ] get the other one he ordered to ream out a hole in it too
	- [ ] schedule transdermal placement, including two i've added holes
	- [ ] ask if I could test post conductivity of existing piercing
	- [ ] ask regarding legality
- [ ] wear cap
- [ ] modify firmware to engage impedance measuring
- [ ] start posting openbci issues and offering small bounties.
      check in with AJ about this first.
- [ ] read impedance from recording using SIMPLE TECHNIQUE
	- [ ] recommend RMS
		- [ ] AFTER you implement RMS, compare noise level
                      to signal level in order to determine best meaurement
                      method and accuracy of result
- [ ] set up to check impedance whenever I store a log
- [ ] set up second device for redundancy

Backburner:
- [ ] switch to transdermals
- [ ] get off wireless; use serial
- [ ] hook up raspberry pi to record directly
- [ ] stream data via e.g. openrealrecord
