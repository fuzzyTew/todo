	Samppa Transdermal: DC resistance w/ multimeter
	
	Resting:
		probe-probe (short) 0.3 Ohm
		extension-extension (short) jumps around
	Alligator clips to probes:
		clip-clip (short): 0.4 Ohm
		transdermal base shaft - transdermal top: 0.7 Ohm
		when screwed tightly: 0.5 Ohm
		top to hydroxyapetite: insulator
		top to wire pressed through hole: 0.5 Ohm !!
			the pressure of the alligator clip is pressing
			the wire into the edge of the corner of the hole
		different arrangement of bottom wire: 0.7 Ohm
		move clip up to decrease pressure: 2.6 Ohm and rising

	It looks like these things might work as is, if the skin bonds tightly
	enough to them through the holes.

	I'll try drilling out a hole to see if it increases the conductivity,
	and e-mail Brian to schedule piercing and get the other to drill it too.

	I drilled one of the holes out to a 16th of an inch and am getting 1.1
	Ohms just resting in it.  It seemed to help a lot.
	With the clip on I get 0.3 ohms.

	The holes appear to be more along the lines of a 32nd of an inch.
	I should get some jewelry bits.
		
	I've measured the DC resistance of one of Samppa's transdermals.
	I'm not seeing any resistance at the shaft, and the threads seem
	to conduct.
	However, the base is coated in grey chalky hydroxyapatite, which
	gives around 4MOhm depending on pressure.  Pressing hard enough
	seems to be able to eliminate the resistance completely, at least
	on the hole corner I tried.
	Simply resting a lead against any part seems to show no conductivity.
		
	Resting a lead in a hole showed no conductivity
