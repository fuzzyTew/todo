If I do not update this todo list, it is because I am suffering from flashbacks of being tortured.  The situation with torture started around 2012 after anti-coal activism in West Virginia and anti-fracking activism in Texas, in both of which I played almost no role but removed some trojans from some activists' computers.  I kept one trojan for a bit, telling somebody I was planning on seeing where it had come from.  Multiple people in my community developed schizophrenia all in the same year from this situation.  I lost my savings, my entire personal records of all my work before that year, and multiple homes, due to this situation, as well as my mind.  [it's mostly clear that whoever did this was pretty detached from it and wasn't trying to harm me specifically, just make sure I was out of the picture.    i am not looking for vindication, but I do want validation and clear records of what happened and how; it altered my life forever.]

I post the above paragraph because resisting the brainwashing, which includes not talking about the experience and rather covering it up completely, is the only way I can do anything at all successfully.  I had an experience where I could engage some behavior while doing it straight in the middle of suffering.  I am seeing if I can repeat that for other valued goals.  I experience sudden changes to my behavior that are difficult to handle, but by magnifying the experiences and making them more brazen, they may change from simple behavior difficulties to severe suffering, flashbacks, and cognitive difficulties, and deep among those lies an eye of the infinite storm.

- [ ] Use this todo list for 1 week, updating it at least daily. {started sunday 5/16}
- [ ] work on openemissions for public security
  - [ ] make a toolkit that others might be able to work off of to construst and test an information-secure environment
    - I needed a secure environment to escape the trojan victimisation I experienced, which intercepted websites I visited, deleted some of my emails, crashed programs and systems when I tried to use them, and monitored me, targeting new devices I purchased.  I could not find a secure environment, so I decided to dedicate myself to making it easier for people to find one.
