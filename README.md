If I do not update this todo list, it is because I am suffering from flashbacks of being tortured.  The situation with torture started around 2012 after anti-coal activism in West Virginia and Texas, in which I played almost no role but removed some trojans from some activists' computers.  I kept one for a bit, telling somebody I was planning on seeing where it had come from.  Multiple people in my community developed schizophrenia all in the same year from this situation.  I lost my savings and multiple homes due to the harm, as well as my mind.

I post the above paragraph because resisting the brainwashing is the only way I can do anything successfully.  I had an experience where I could engage some behavior while doing it straight in the middle of suffering.  I am seeing if I can repeat that for other valued goals.  I experience sudden changes to my behavior that are difficult to handle, but by magnifying the experiences and making them more brazen, they may change from simple behavior difficulties to severe suffering, flashbacks, and cognitive difficulties, and deep among those lies an eye of the infinite storm.
