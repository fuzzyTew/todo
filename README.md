2021-05-25 We are at about 50% with regarding to being able to look at this todo list again.
The 50% is holding while we heal around cognitive habits that are severely injuring our consciousness, and then we expect to quickly access it better when we remember to do so.
The healing regarding cognitive injury is making progress, but has hit a temporary setback.

To help around healing cognitive harm, there are two ideas:
- Metrics of cognitive injury (we have mc around this and it seems medicine is faster than us, but it is likely still helpful)
- Strength training around protection of reference influences (this is a possible cognitive practice)

                 this means being able to consider things without considering harm.
                    it's not well-labeled.  karl has a long-running internal habit
                    of brainstorming how to harm his cognition around everything he
                    consciously thinks, and then acting on that quickly.  is near joke
                    and boss-trade.  takes strength to not do this.  with safe-strength
                    we expect to become a little safer.]
                    [there is timing involved in this.  after learning a little, give
                     us time to get used to it as different parts of the mind are
                     exposed to it in the context of the issue.]
                        [hypnotherapist might be able to help with that.  unsure.]
                            [it engages old personal spaces of karl's where he
                             has conscious-neurons that can influence his undesired
                             thoughts and schizotypal experiences.  all these neurons
                             are mind-controlled now, but karl and they both recognise
                             each other, they are just being doped by huge bad signals.]
  The above-mentioned bad-signal doping is one of the most important things to us.  We expect it is not hard to identify with brain monitoring research equipment.  We would happily pay a lot of money to see and influence it.  Drugs likely influence it.  We have mc around using the drugs without some kind of measurement that they are helping this cognitive experience, and our reason-network that we use to resist mc values that measurement too.
  - note to self: if succeedable, mc resistance priority around regaining control of thought influence.  =>one path was found, to retake willpower.  it seems helpful to build safe walls to protect from harm-spread when acting.  expecting: to get more parts and consciousness doing these safe walls.<=

Karl, I'm sorry this todo list re-attempt didn't work out.

Please try to do behaviors that seem like they accomplish something, especially if you are suffering.

If I do not update this todo list, it is because I am suffering from flashbacks of being tortured.  The situation with torture started around 2012 after anti-coal activism in West Virginia and anti-fracking activism in Texas, in both of which I played almost no role but removed some trojans from some activists' computers.  I kept one trojan for a bit, telling somebody I was planning on seeing where it had come from.  Multiple people in my community developed schizophrenia all in the same year from this situation.  I lost my savings, my entire personal records of all my work before that year, and multiple homes, due to this situation, as well as my mind.  [it's mostly clear that whoever did this was pretty detached from it and wasn't trying to harm me specifically, just make sure I was out of the picture.    i am not looking for vindication, but I do want validation and clear records of what happened and how; it altered my life forever.  if it's not obvious, I have no idea how to act on that helpfully through any normal channels.  Maybe I need to engage a therapist or hypnotherapist or advocate who can help me bring evidence to authorities; it is very hard to do this with the brainwashing countering it throughout my mind.]

I post the above paragraph because resisting the brainwashing, which includes not talking about the experience and rather covering it up completely, is the only way I can do anything at all successfully.  I had an experience where I could engage some behavior while doing it straight in the middle of suffering.  I am seeing if I can repeat that for other valued goals.  I experience sudden changes to my behavior that are difficult to handle, but by magnifying the experiences and making them more brazen, they may change from simple behavior difficulties to severe suffering, flashbacks, and cognitive difficulties, and deep among those lies an eye of the infinite storm.

- [ ] Change this todo list to be goal-oriented, and dedicate all time to doing that for 2 days straight. [goal set 5/19]
- [ ] Use this todo list for 1 week, updating it at least daily. {started sunday 5/16, continued thru 5/19 but developed a priority disjunction by 5/19}
- [ ] set up/use a timelogging system to allocate time to todo items
      - keep this casual but keep it around.  once we have a sense of concern around how much time spent on something, it can be used to integrate decisions, time, and todo together.  all it needs to do is give us a way to spread our time among worries, when dissociated.  the worry needs to suggest an increasingly valid use of time.
- [ ] merge this branch onto the fuzzytew upstream repo, maybe cherrypick or rebase could help
- [ ] work on openemissions for public security
  - [ ] make a toolkit that others might be able to work off of to construst and test an information-secure environment
    - I needed a secure environment to escape the trojan victimisation I experienced, which intercepted websites I visited, deleted some of my emails, crashed programs and systems when I tried to use them, and monitored me, targeting new devices I purchased.  I could not find a secure environment, so I decided to dedicate myself to making it easier for people to find one.
    - [ ] make or find a software signal generator usable with arbitrary software defined radios, to test the walls of potential shielded enclosures
      - [ ] bring together a transmitting radio, a receiving radio, and a cable capable of the connecting the two together, to test with
        - [X] turns out I don't have a transmitting sdr that I know where is.  I have a high quality radio that needs a transmitting expansion, but purchasing that is a poor investment for me this month
        - [X] I outlined a gnuradio sink to transmit from a raspberry pi gpio pin.  This would let me unify the approach with my 'noiscillate' experiment.  committed outline to my openemissions repo.
        - [ ] convert the pigpio gnuradio sink to 'char' to easily fix a compile issue.  alternative is a slight refactoring to handle the templates.
        - [ ] read briefly about using an audio antenna with gnuradio (for _transmitting_ and _receiving_, both ends) -> can we use a level shifter to send/receive E-waves with this?
        - [ ] and/or find another sdr I've misplaced that may transmit
- [ ] work on fuse++ for personal development
  - [ ] port forward to fuse3 so that can test on system running fuse3
  - [ ] port a test from libfuse
- [ ] reopen my calendar file and resume using it
- [ ] get personal logging going
  - [ ] verify videos play from current surveillance system
  - [ ] set up another system in truck
- [ ] integrate other todo items together
- [ ] potential friend requests we switch our culture to use AI so as to stay relevant, likely a good idea

Issue log:
  - 2021-05-17 My networked dev machine has stopped booting.  It says "libgcc_s.so.1: cannot open shared object file" for every one of my 3 kernel and initramfs pairs.  It's hard to judge how to engage it due to brainwashing against some of the normal approaches, which makes them much harder to consider and pursue.  I think it would be best to back the system up and install a fresh system.  Additionally, coinbase-pro on my phone is not accepting UI input, which makes it hard to access more funds.
    - I spent that entire day working on that and resolved it.  There were multiple issues combining on the laptop.  The phone let me use coinbase after some reboots and time.  By that time I had changed my mind on withdrawing money, as my last btc purchases were above the current price.
