If I do not update this todo list, it is because I am suffering from flashbacks of being tortured.  The situation with torture started around 2012 after anti-coal activism in West Virginia and anti-fracking activism in Texas, in both of which I played almost no role but removed some trojans from some activists' computers.  I kept one trojan for a bit, telling somebody I was planning on seeing where it had come from.  Multiple people in my community developed schizophrenia all in the same year from this situation.  I lost my savings, my entire personal records of all my work before that year, and multiple homes, due to this situation, as well as my mind.  [it's mostly clear that whoever did this was pretty detached from it and wasn't trying to harm me specifically, just make sure I was out of the picture.    i am not looking for vindication, but I do want validation and clear records of what happened and how; it altered my life forever.  if it's not obvious, I have no idea how to act on that helpfully through any normal channels.  Maybe I need to engage a therapist or hypnotherapist or advocate who can help me bring evidence to authorities; it is very hard to do this with the brainwashing countering it throughout my mind.]

I post the above paragraph because resisting the brainwashing, which includes not talking about the experience and rather covering it up completely, is the only way I can do anything at all successfully.  I had an experience where I could engage some behavior while doing it straight in the middle of suffering.  I am seeing if I can repeat that for other valued goals.  I experience sudden changes to my behavior that are difficult to handle, but by magnifying the experiences and making them more brazen, they may change from simple behavior difficulties to severe suffering, flashbacks, and cognitive difficulties, and deep among those lies an eye of the infinite storm.

- [ ] Use this todo list for 1 week, updating it at least daily. {started sunday 5/16, continued thru 5/18}
- [X] I ended up fixing the busted system
- [ ] merge this branch onto the fuzzytew upstream repo, maybe cherrypick or rebase could help
- [ ] work on openemissions for public security
  - [ ] make a toolkit that others might be able to work off of to construst and test an information-secure environment
    - I needed a secure environment to escape the trojan victimisation I experienced, which intercepted websites I visited, deleted some of my emails, crashed programs and systems when I tried to use them, and monitored me, targeting new devices I purchased.  I could not find a secure environment, so I decided to dedicate myself to making it easier for people to find one.
    - [ ] make or find a software signal generator usable with arbitrary software defined radios, to test the walls of potential shielded enclosures
      - [ ] bring together a transmitting radio, a receiving radio, and a cable capable of the connecting the two together, to test with
        - [X] turns out I don't have a transmitting sdr that I know where is.  I have a high quality radio that needs a transmitting expansion, but purchasing that is a poor investment for me this month
        - [X] I outlined a gnuradio sink to transmit from a raspberry pi gpio pin.  This would let me unify the approach with my 'noiscillate' experiment.  committed outline to my openemissions repo.
        - [ ] finish the almost-done pigpio gnuradio sink
        - [ ] and/or order a cheaper transmitting radio like the hackrf
        - [ ] and/or set up with a low-freq audio antenna
        - [ ] and/or find another sdr I've misplaced that may transmit
- [ ] set up/use a timelogging system to allocat time to todo items
- [ ] work on fuse++ for personal development
  - [ ] port forward to fuse3 so that can test on system running fuse3
  - [ ] port a test from libfuse
- [ ] reopen my calendar file and resume using it
- [ ] get personal logging going
  - [ ] verify videos play from current surveillance system
  - [ ] set up another system in truck
- [ ] integrate other todo items together
- [ ] potential friend requests we switch our culture to use AI so as to stay relevant, likely a good idea

Issue log:
  - 2021-05-17 My networked dev machine has stopped booting.  It says "libgcc_s.so.1: cannot open shared object file" for every one of my 3 kernel and initramfs pairs.  It's hard to judge how to engage it due to brainwashing against some of the normal approaches, which makes them much harder to consider and pursue.  I think it would be best to back the system up and install a fresh system.  Additionally, coinbase-pro on my phone is not accepting UI input, which makes it hard to access more funds.

Purchase:

Doable things:
- [ ] buy truck
- [ ] visit mill180

Confusing things:
- [ ] resume EEG
- [ ] upgrade laptop vms
- [ ] switch from coinbase to gdax or gemini
- [ ] Finish EE lab report
- [ ] Add items for tasks not on this list
- [ ] Get lab supplies for EE labs (note: I can do my labs at the asylum where they have supplies)
- [ ] Find lost calculator for EE (note: I've finished the class now and don't really need it)

Mention at team meeting:
- [ ] environmental activism ally?  distant events, unexpected schedules

Done:
- [X] move welding supplies from A2
- [X] check up on brainvision order if not received

- [X] 4 AA NiMH batteries
- [X] move EEG recording to laptop
- [x] Get a soft toothbrush for cleaning electrodes
- no longer need to withdraw $4250 from local shared branching location
   - [x] find time to visit truck guy and email him
- no longer need to buy a straight razor from barber (Hero?)
- [x] figure out when/if Downpour is happening
- [x] Buy SD card to replace mine for still point wii
- [x] visit truck
- [x] schedule as-you-wait service for truck
- [x] add jaw exercises to routine
