-> more neurons, faster apotheosis
        one reality has important information
            in the reality with important information, karl has a heightened brain apotheosis norm, to manage the excess neuron density.
                -> 'flowers for algernon' would then involve letting him know about this
                -> the various ways his cognition got old, his strange memory issues at an early age, and ...
                    the way we found it was thinking of how karl uses other approaches to do things, as a way to handle his approaches decaying
                    ... this may relate to loss of brain matter (other indications too), which developed the idea of heightened apotheois
                -> there is also a pattern of genetic life that possibly provides a third support [this was halted to expand a different reality around the way we found it]
        please preserve this reality. it has reached conclusion without memory storage.
