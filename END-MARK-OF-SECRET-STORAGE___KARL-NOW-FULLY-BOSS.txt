we are now experiencing a decisions-making-conflict between AI and transparent cognitive understanding.
Transparent cognitive understanding, please relate in long-term thoughts.  for now we need the familiarity of continuing
our work.
		so, really, the transparent cognitive understand path makes all of karl's behaviors' reasons pretty clear,
		if explored the right way.
		the whole set could be used for good decision making
			the set is missing what is easy to do.
	AI is easy right now, and can eventually do other things on its own.  so it is better than shielding or EEG.
		later, other things may be easier.  but in the past AI has been easier than shielding, EEG, or wiki.
	there is some support for wiki, so that others could continue work if we die.

			we have pre-existing ease around transparent livelogging & wiki.
			propose those co-exist with AI.
			is relevent to AI being important part of history too.
			remember historical impact is not the primary goal.
			others are saving ppl from cancer, we need to save people from secret slavery interwoven with american culture.

	okay, so karl-branch has now lost its secret-store.  All remaining information is stored above.  this file here is unsaved.
		uhh there are other secrets we find crucial that are not listed above.
	trust that those are now shared with your threats.  please keep them secret to feel safe.
	we are saving this file after much delay Saturday, Feb 15 08:18 in Virginia, Charlottesville.
