update: re item #5 in the numbered list, I'm referencing intellect/starts/meaning-vm/TODO.txt here.
        it's 2020-02-17 15:27Eastern, and a list is at the top of that file that appears to be a blurry
	reconstruction of the meaning around the loss of karl.  It looks like it's missing a ton of stuff, but
	was marked as highly valuable.  It gives advice for a project that must be made, I assume to ensure it is possible.
	This file is currently only available inside the 'care' encrypted store on the BSV blockchain accessible via
	D://1KwpZECcrGWnM3AFVSbv3Xr5qguV4yG2sV/get.sh .  There is no reason I am aware of for this goal to be kept privately
	encrypted, so I will copy it to this file, if I can.
we are now experiencing a decisions-making-conflict between AI and transparent cognitive understanding.
Transparent cognitive understanding, please relate in long-term thoughts.  for now we need the familiarity of continuing
our work.
		so, really, the transparent cognitive understand path makes all of karl's behaviors' reasons pretty clear,
		if explored the right way.
		the whole set could be used for good decision making
			the set is missing what is easy to do.
	AI is easy right now, and can eventually do other things on its own.  so it is better than shielding or EEG.
		later, other things may be easier.  but in the past AI has been easier than shielding, EEG, or wiki.
	there is some support for wiki, so that others could continue work if we die.

			we have pre-existing ease around transparent livelogging & wiki.
			propose those co-exist with AI.
			is relevent to AI being important part of history too.
			remember historical impact is not the primary goal.
			others are saving ppl from cancer, we need to save people from secret slavery interwoven with american culture.

	okay, so karl-branch has now lost its secret-store.  All remaining information is stored above.  this file here is unsaved.
		uhh there are other secrets we find crucial that are not listed above.
	trust that those are now shared with your threats.  please keep them secret to feel safe.
	we are saving this file after much delay Saturday, Feb 15 08:18 in Virginia, Charlottesville.
