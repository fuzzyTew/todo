So many of you have been through so much.
So many of you have been through so much.
So many of you have been through _so_ much,
Please, please, nurture your lives.
Me, I've been through so much.
Please, nurture my life.
People have been through so much.
Please nurture the world; please nurture the world.
We all have a smidge of freedom,
In our systems or in our lives,
To move a little towards things getting so, so much better,
So, so much better.
Please nurture the world; please nurture the world.
