O: i'm having halting thoughts
O: i'm associating the halting with different beliefs and perceptions in my mind
		having to do with other entities having opinions about my behavior

F: scared

N/D: live my life honestly and productively
     respect the emotions and needs of others -> to support wellbeing of everyone in so many ways
     not experience nasty things like losing my sense of where i am, my ability to move around, or my ability to sleep
	-> needing to think clearly and experience conistently
	-> needing freedom to move and pursue behaviors that meet other needs (autonomy)
	-> needing rest and ease
	-> needing productivity

(notable that i live by having a willingness to put all these needs aside, in service to them in the long term)

"today was going to be productive wrt logistics ... would be silly to threaten that to meet small emotion"
	-> taken back, not meant anymore


- influence request that karl be completely inhibited for rest of life
	reason seems to be to prevent karl from aiding work that harms international industrial infrastructure
		

- karl wants to be able to work to protect deeply natural systems and ways of life


	belief that such people hold that extreme industry greatly harms these things, can even create genocide

influence is against genocide !

one might imagine an individual influence that is against genocide
but also more distant influences that would be willing to engage in genocide for profit
	especially if they believed the group being extermnated was bad

- need to do what is necessary and right

	- desire to include everyone and everything

desire to respct the needs bhind these behaviors ... /rest lost/ we're having trouble with these behaviors; how do we meet the
needs that cause them?

shift is how people become willing to do and need different things when they truly feel they are heard and that they matter
