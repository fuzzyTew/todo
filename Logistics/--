			Karl & Jim 2018-11-14

			Let's come up with kind of an agenda queue strategy, and agree to it in advance.
			If we need to behave differently from that, we re-evaluate it.
			Propose topics and actions enter a FIFO or priority queue, and are dicussed only when their point is reached.
			For highest priority topics, time limits imposed.

			- Meeting with Gwyn 12p
