		-> I thought I told SS that I had an appt at 11.  serviceman said he could come
	           earlier and finish before 11 (which is very tight time!) I think i must have
	           miscommunicated, because he arrived very close to 11 and stayed through 11.
	           I ended up asking him to leave when he did not leave at 11, rather rudely.
	           I really did not enjoy doing this; I felt so rude and mean and couldn't quite
	           handle it.  I ended up apologizing to Jeremy and hanging up on him because
	           having said this to the southern states tech was so rough for me.

	-> came back from gwyn's, did some coding, resumed nicotine brushing
	-> at first had no memory of this day, but that is normal when i spend a day coding.  i don't do that very much anymore.
- [ ] 2018-11-10 Sat
	- [X] 9a or 10a:  visit Christine, remember Gwyn coming in afternoon
	-> got christine's tire fixed, she ended up spending a lot of time begging and yelling towards her mother on my phone
	   I was able to help them communicate at first, but then I started freezing up, managed to contact Kate and Jim
	   eventually and Jim asked Christine to leave.  she started leaving but then called her mother again; I ended up
	   falling asleep and she was gone when I woke.
	   she had left me some dvds she feels she needs to watch, but she has no dvd player.  i began copying them to convert
	   them to a phone, but she returned and took them back when the process was barely started.  i haven't seen her since.
	   i hope she finds a dvd player because she feels the dvds will help her adjust her behavior so much.
	   i hope she is alive.  she's sleeping in her car and the temperature is dropping the lowest it has in the history
	   of the area according to jim.  she isn't eating much and when she is in somebody else's car she blasts the heat
	   as high as it goes and keeps it there.
	- [ ] Address some UPCOMING list items.  Add a logged number for how long the list is.
	- [ ] Gwyn visits afternoon through possibly Sunday in-and-out
	-> gwyn ended up taking me to her place.  i wanted to support her to have space from her abusive ex-husband, but it ended
	   up he wasn't visiting that week, so I spent time with her anyway because I didn't want to rudely ask for space myself.
	   it took me a day to really recover from the christine experience enough to do anything, which still feels really
	   unresolved

		- [ ] 7:00p brushing
	-> The local electrosensitives introduced me to a new woman in the area named Christine who is in great need, medically
	   and psychologically, and is highly sensitive to the smells released by most buildings and won't enter them without
	   wearing a complex breathing device and experiencing increased suffering.
	   I spent the second half of this day with this woman, helping her find food (she hadn't eaten in a long time due
	   to sensitivities to the food) and listening to her, and making sure she had a place to sleep for that night that
	   helped her suffer less.  She is very new to not living indoors and appears terrified of her current life.
	   I feel very burnt out working to care for this woman in the midst of my memeory and awareness issues.  I asked
	   Gwyn for help but she was having a rough time herself.  I feel very irritated at Gwyn for not being able to help
	   Christine.
	   It's notable that Christine is also a name from my psychosis and my history, representing somebody I very much
	   want to help and have love for.
	   I stopped my nicotine and my work this day to help this person, and I very much want space and ease to resume
	   my work.  I've also discovered my money situation is much less than I thought it was.  Gwyn loaned me some money
	   and I wrote her a check twice to repay it, but both times I messed up with balancing my money and the checks
	   bounced.  Gwyn needs the money to pay her life expenses.
	   I plan to spend some time today Sat the 10th improving my money situation and to find the money to repay Gwyn
	   by the end of the day.  I'm creating the 'FINANCIAL' section in my organizer file above the 'calendar' section.
	   I also want to prepare for the day enough to pick up Christine at 9 or 10 AM and help her get her car fixed as
	   I promised.
	   I think I would feel a lot nicer in these situations if I had some friends who are also passionate about helping
	   people in this way.  I used to hang out with many of them, but I have not connected with anybody in the area
	   like this.  It was on my goal list to do just to help me feel nice, but I think once I start living it the need
	   is stronger.
