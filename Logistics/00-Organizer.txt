RACI
who's Responsible, who's Accountable, Communication, Information


Scheduling plan for nicotine box:
	- empty slots in schedule that items from Tasks queue are placed in
	- Tasks queue is priority queue
	- each item has a Behavior, and a Category
	- each Category may have a Verifier that can be used to determine reward (different ones may use same verifier)

	I can start this before nicotine starts, which will give me some progress tracking

	- I could mention to jim the bubbling in my ear that happens when I burp or hold my nose and press


lewisburg:
- health food stores
- hardware stores
- can get a passport
- truck mechanic?

Goals at # GOALWORK
==
Now: 2018-11-17 14:50 ET
Goal: list to refer to to stay on task
Ready behaviors: brushing, working on scuttlebutt bridge
Pressures I'm ignoring: keeping room clean, addressing obligations, what else?
Difficulties: pressured tasks causing ability to decrease -- prefer to do ready tasks
Challenges I'm engaging: routine around brushing, maybe doing it 50%
		hope to optimize use of brushing routine to resolve difficulty tasks
Biggest issue:
	- plan time
	- organize goals
	- craft strategy to manage time
		I want/need to craft a strategy to aid in managing my time using brushing routine.
		But it is very hard to access any information around this goal.

TDE:
	Time spent
	Difficulty
	Effectiveness

I1 checking rating works and including quiz result in output
	Subjective Rating: 80% effort 5% time

-I6 resume exercising
	Subjective Rating: 50%
-I7 get back on scuttlebutt & respond to wiley
	Subjective Rating: 0%
-I8 UPCOMING list in calendar
-I9 preparing for tomorrow
-IA merging these lists
-IB visiting some caverns and noting if there is an opportunity to hang out
-IC getting my EEG
-ID making a pluggable blockchain & swarm storage interface
-IZ making plans to visit massachusetts

== General ==
0. Managing this list of concerns
	- integrate with other goal/todo lists
		: consider adding these items to 00-Organizer.txt and quizzing on its contents!
1. getting better at being aware of my present concerns
	-> could dual-n-back help? at least a good practice
	   may be more exercise known to improve mind in general too
	-> reviewing things I've written, acted on, done, said, heard, places I've gone online, in person, etc other than this list

2. time management & priority adjustment
	- For all my tasks, I should do the work that is hardest for others to do other than me.
		Then I can queue up work that others can do.
	- my programming projects should be bounties, forums, etc
	- my shielding pursuits should be a research project
	- my logistics should be delegated and organized such that they use up reasonable time
	- my time should be spent optimizing my approaches and plans

	- unifying goals / tasks / scheduling information locations, into 00-Organizer.txt for now
		- [X] this file
		- routines lists
		- ttrack? (above)
		- nic program? (above)
	- how far away deadlines, plans, events are
	- time tracker, n2 scheduler
		- LET'S HAVE 1 PRIMARY GOAL, and spend HALF OF TIME on it.  then it will take twice as long, as other goals available in other time
			- will need to accommodate frozen time ... maybe associate with n2 but not time allocation.  track, also track problem events
		- see also 'nicotine' under autonomy pursuit below
	- working with jim
-3. emails
	- catching up
		- new emails
		- recent starred emails
		- emails that occurred around the newsletter ddos I received
	- old starred emails
	- mailing lists i've joined or tried to join
-4. ongoing obligations
	- truck stuck in mud
	- interpersonal responsibilities
		- where might I find these?
		- "maintaining relationships" below
		- UPCOMING list
		- voicemails
		- emails
		- facebook
-5. older concerns
-6. things left unaddressed in nvc doc
	- feelings, needs, requests that haven't been gone through
		-> Jim, I have a document where I have pursued examining my intense feelings and needs and thinking of things to do with them, but I haven't done anything with much of the information
	- I'd like to do the feeling->thought->observation->need->request habit throughout the day, as i encounter feelings,
	        and record them to work with them
-7. autonomy pursuit
	- nicotine and ideas for using it
		- maintain daily habit
		- decide on new approach for dispenser / box and work on that more effectively
		- address list of nic habit goals, farther down in this file
		- doing time intensive routines less frequently, or decreasing time (time management above)
	- NVC
		- resolving flags by working with persistent information
		- adjusting external dialogue to use nvc
		- adjusting internal dialogue to use nvc
		- ready access to observations, feelings, needs
		- nvc with voices
		- online courses
		- book study
		- study with friends
		- physical courses, practice groups
		- street giraffes
	- shielding
		- Coding noiscillate
		- interaction with telescope
		- getting involved in rtl-sdr development
		- EE degree (physics degree?)
		- EMC study
		- internship?
		- real world outreach?
		- hobby infosec communities
	- eeg
		- algorithms checkin with others e.g. eeglablist attempt to post
			- left out concept of subtracting overlapped signals to isolate them with feedback.  could test this on noise to see whether it works
		- guy in wv (is this in my ongoing list in calendar?)
			-> add calendar event to move forward on this after set date from last contact
					-> probably try cnotcating him via other means
		- ecog internationally?
		- university research for thought-controlled devices
		- openbci / muse / zeo
		- continuous eeg price
	- censor-resistant collaboration
		- scuttlebutt
			- concern regarding recovery from corruption?
		- blockchain-based
		- anonymity-focused
	- reliable logging
		- might want to resolve this one with some nvc introspection
			- training is something i'll want, but doesn't need reliability
				- finding missing objects could still become relevant
			- personal safety could be relevant occasionally
		- openrealrecord/hyperstream
			- bookmoons work
			- other PR's
		- ongoing video (also for comfort with it)
	- helpful environments
		- education, internships, volunteering, jobs
		- caverns, radios, shielding, NVC, BCI research
	- collaboration
		- collaboration training e.g. NVC?
		- jim, riley, kate, jeremy, brian decker/samppa
		- internet people
		- meeting new people who want to work or help
		- following up with people who can help
-8. health

-9. maintaining relationships (should add these to ongoing)
	- Owe Katrina a call?
	- i called mom
	- VISIT PARENTS at least once a year !!!
	- Old / current loves
		- gwyn, kate
		- azia, kyla, christine, molly, sarah capra?
		- groups i've interacted with
			- possible new ones
	- Old / current friends
		- electrosensitives
		- SLR people
		- MPSS
		- Portland
		- childhood / school
		- groups i've interacted with
-10. finances
	- set up trading policy ... can somehow get somebody else to actually perform it?
	- maintain minimum balance on account
	- budget so as to provide for savings to increase
	- reach out to father to support legitimate expenses
	- consider choosing 1 reliable source of income?
	- followup on localethereum & interpersonal trades
	- keep debt to 50% maximum to provide space for interest

## NICOTINE AUTONOMY PLANNING
	STATUS:
		forgot where I'm at. note here.

	NEXT STEP:
		DISPENSER:
			- rebuild but use low-viscosity
			  after dispense, increase viscosity by mixing with powder
			  baking soda, toothbrushing powder, etc
		consolidate next steps
		sources:
			- this doc
				- this section
				- present concerns section
			- projects folder
			- logistics folder
			- routine folder

	IDEAL PLAN:
		- dosing applied frequently throughout the day, automatically and securely, based on testable metrics

- I'd like to start this.
	- Program reads from todo repo, stored in todo repo.
	- Service installed on filesystem from source in todo repo for now.
	- Move goals to this organizer doc.
	- Connect relay to toggle power to dispenser.  Time based on reward.
- References elsewhere: ../routine/ttrack/ttrack.py comments at top
- I really need a TIME MANAGEMENT next step !!!!!
	GOAL: using n2 helps me meet my goals
	SUBGOAL: program checks tasks, doses result

	WORK INCLUDES:
		- routine system prompts me to continue (already)
		- tasks system allows time logging (already)
		- new code might do both in a modular way (in progress)
	NEED:
		- SET OF KNOWLEDGE TO MANAGE.  schedule? goals? randomness?
			consider starting with TTRACK system which already tracks hours and prioritizes somewhat
	NEXT:
		- convert brushing routine to rewards

# GOALWORK
0: autonomy, safety, privacy, and joyful pursuit of dreams for all
Problem:
	dominant culture using oppressive technology to eradicate other cultures
	and establish universal hierarchy of power and control
Routes for safety:
	- reliable collaboration & information sharing
	- TOOLS to comprehend issues, e.g. EEG and radio work
	- TECHNIQUES to get things done, such as nicotine

	Short term:
	- nicotine & technocratic motivators and logs
	- collaboration with others who can help?

	Medium term:
	- nonviolent communication
	- uncensorable dialogue & information storage?
	- caverns?

	Likely lonegr term:
	- shielded rooms
	- radiowork
	- EEG analysis, but helpful to have ongoing logging
		could be faster with outreach etc

	==> UNCENSORABLE DIALOGUE IS NEEDED BAD <==
	If you start being productive without it, you can just enter a bubble.
	This includes both the problem of technology and the problem of reaching others with the technology.

	I think the best route would be a SIMPLE bitcoin messenger.
	Probably a mobile phone app running bcoin.
	- [ ] Check first if one already exists.
	- [ ] Make a fund for people to message freely with it.
1: personal requirements of life fully maintained
	- want to stay on top of obligations and expectations
		- UPCOMING list
		- present concerns list
		- nonlisted expectations
		- other lists
	- want to pursue personal wellness responsibly
		- lyme disease
		- neurology
		- daily routine & cleanliness
		- habits in support of mental thriving e.g. do enough things myself to retain abilities
	- want to be able to fucntion with ease in my living situation
		- organize possessions
			- want to SAVE all my documents and objects and regularly spend a small amount of time comprehending them
			- should keep a categorical inventory and work with others to organize possessions
			- should work to shrink and archive possessions, selling them
	- want to live kindly in all ways, and slowly move towards that ideal
	- want to support ideals, people, etc that I value





- personal consistency: to do what I want,

# ACTIONABLE TASKS

## home
- [X?] clean phone contacts

## computer
- [ ] Organization / Todo (feel free to REORDER)
	- [ ] import paper items from the 2 notebooks
		- [ ] todo items
		- [ ] information items
		- [ ] other items
	- [ ] unify projects & tasks systems into this repo
		- day is spent on different ACTIVITIES which consist of priority TASKS from a PROJECT or GOAL?
		- information and tracking of activities and projects is stored in folders regarding them
			Goals vs Activities vs Projects?  does it matter?  I'm stuck on Kate's desire to distinguish between these.
			Since it's just me, let's switch to GOALS which have PARENT and SIBLING GOALS.
		- projects/activities concept: activites == actionable tasks == each fits in time alloction system on phone
		- use PROJECTS folder to organize what needs to be done in general
			- activities folder would be a sibling.  we already have TASKS folder that can be the same.
		- concepts here are GOALS/SUBGOALS/PROJECTS/ONGOING ACTIVITIES, REASONS AND PRIORITIES FOR GOALS, PLACE TO TRACK INFORMATION ON GOAL, TASKS, and PRIORITIES AND DEADLINES FOR TASKS
			- phone tasks system allows to split time between goals or activities.  can mesh in.
		-> OKAY: ACTIVITIES are phone goals/tasks that have time split between them.  This is why there's a separate activities folder: it's the level at which time is split.
	- [ ] make script to sync with phone, other vms, and sd card AUTOMATICALLY
		- [X] install adb for sys-net
		- [X] set up syncing between vms on qubes
			-> src/gitbundleautosync on dev-whonix
		- [ ] autosync everything when device plugged
	- [ ] sort cruft below
		- [X] DEAL WITH 'design tent interior' -- this is related to the goal of immediately increasing personal shielding
					not as important as having a tool to measure SE in general, but a goal I had, that should at least get organized
	- [ ] I'm having trouble having regular meals: come up with some foods I enjoy making (both for the joy of making & sourcing, and for the health and ease) and make a system to make food mroe available for me
			-> maybe schedule a dumpster visit, and some gathring?  there are apples and acorns everywhere, and I'm not done with apple pres

## internet
- [ ] find when my neurological testing is, maybe a voicemail could indicate? maybe med portal?
	-> they called me to get insurance information
	   I think I called them back at 434-924-2718 and provided it
- [ ] get an awareness class
	-> awakening the senses costs $600 ....
- [ ] share my gitbundleautosync projects; they're useful tools
- [_] sign up for another nvcacademy course
	-> still doing convergent fac
- [ ] download history of a volatile crypto? from an exchange that trades it
- [ ] withdraw $ for GBT, MPSS, Diane, Truck


## truck
- [ ] slowly unpack the truck in order to scan docs (or find other scanning solution)


#### BACKBURNER

# important
- [ ] design modular solution for holding possessions and arranging day-to-day life (drawers? sink? compost? etc)
- [ ] open-source cell phone
- [ ] put tent/modular room/etc in truck
- [ ] look for volunteer work (telescope? nearby city?)
- [ ] research land near telescope using tax assessor maps (any areas more restricted than mine?)

# fun
- [ ] get a piano (upright still exists)

#### ONGOING TASKS

# active
- pursue proper shielding
- pursue short-term increased shielding
	- put tent in truck

# really important
- household chores
- unpack & organize
- papers (collate, scan)
- new emails, starred emails, voicemails & such life obligations
- old todo items
- finances: automate bitcoin investments?

# important
- copper room / test box
- learn to weld
- pursue 24/7 EEG
	- pursue dermals and transdermals
- pursue video surveillance / self-recording
- learn emissions of sound & EM
- learn EE, Physics, Math
- learn radios, 24/7 radio logging

# fun
- live without imports, money, or causing suffering in other life (instead nurture surrounding life); relearn awareness & connect with others
	- solar

#### THINGS TO CHANGE ABOUT MY INNER HABITS
- getting up in morning (staying in bed at night, or at least resting consistently)
- crypto: using pgp, putting coins on airgapped phone, getting new airgapped phone
- adhering to a daily schedule, throughout the day, and using time-tracking system
- time spent in shower
- time spent in morning routine
	-> could associate N2 with time spent doing morning routine
	-> probably helpful if had N2 after different spots in morning routine
	-> remember N2 must be provided by habit-building activity, otherwise could take without association
			-> could fix by creating secure device to dispense N2

- willpower with regard to comforts (hold bathroom in, shower in cold temperature, do difficult tasks)
	-> could put some of these tasks inside my N2 activity

- addressing TODO items, INBOX items, IMPORTANT items
	-> could associate N2 with things coming off of this list
		-> sounds a little delayed, but if I did the items prior to an N2 activity it might work
		-> maybe add a mid-day routine
	-> should give list a maximum count so that highest priority items occupy it

- errors and spasms to decrease
	-> could measure quality or rapidity of tasks
	-> could be easier with EEG
	-> CAN TRACK computer accuracy! missing mouse clicks, clicking wrong tabs, using backspace key or deleting in vi ...

- vision holes
	-> could actually design peripheral vision device.  very gratifying.  just need digital projector with wide-angle lens
- short term memory
	-> could use memory task such as dual n-back.  may encounter second issue of context
- staying energized in face of 'flags'
	-> could note flags and review them, work with concepts around them ... seems intense
	   could also note important events of de-energizing and just work with those, focused on my goals

- keeping room clean and ORGANIZED
- remembering my possessions

- real results with regard to executive functioning and task/information organization
	-> not sure how to measure this

- effectiveness of coding

- complete silence and peace in my mind, clarity of thinking, memory working
	-> mostly subjective for now, but could modulate some other goal with subjective judgement.  seems to work

- stopping driving to lubricate my eye
	-> could combine with any other task, while driving
	-> schedule break during drive, for lubrication etc?
	-> use pocket lubricant when doing regular lubrication, to build ease of access

- ability to generalize plans; hold schedule in my mind;--> include infornation when making decisions<--; brainstorm

- adding to a record of subjective events (such as sudden memory loss etc)
	-> could provide nicotine immediately with addition
	-> but then also want to decrease event .... maybe change regarding time
			e.g. could reward immediately, but decrease normal outside greater than reward by a little
			but that would train the event
			could also reward immediately, but over time decrease reward, while having consistency wrt decreasing next dose too

# CRUFT TO SORT UP

## every shift 10 minutes:
- [ ] interpersonal notes
	^-- what did I mean by interpersonal here?  judging by surrounding items, I might be working with existing objects that I have ... or I might be practivcing taking them
- [ ] papers and planning
	-- note this was separate from interpersonal notes ...
 ====>		there might be clues in the history, e.g. my 'daily tasks' goal of my morning routne.  these were likely separate tasks





## doable task ideas
set up internet
 Make a project for working on these organization systems.
 work on EE lab report for 6 hours total
 make door for trailer
 build simple trailer (1 alu layer)
 hire tech-savvy researcher, worker, executive assistant
 review local resources from activist planner; zine place only opens for events
 make haven phone work
 finish backup of old drive data, remember my annex is in there!
 buy truck
 update trailer sticker
 get a new eye doctor
 visit mill180
 visit artsy place katie found
 visit makerspace to the south
 restaple walls trailer
 sync inventory list with this repo
 resume symptom log; staff can help
 figure out if mt.gox will give me my money or if I am too late

## confusing task ideas
- [ ] submit job posting, could mention familiarity with linux command line and neuroscience or machine learning
- [ ] clean laptop using high concentration rubbing alcohol
- [ ] check bridge st packages
- [ ] get dermal tops removed
- [ ] get ears pierced
- [ ] get more dermals, replace any dermals not working
- [ ] put bounty on prereq for hyperdb improvement
- [ ] run bounty updater and keep it running always
- [ ] put bounty on rest of tasks needed to create dat sensor and video streams, databases, websites, and archives that are timestamped on blockchain
- [ ] put bounties on openbci issues
- [ ] do my morning routine
- [ ] get my cbd oil from the car, take it, and mark having took it
- [ ] put salt water on my piercings
- [ ] open the mail I got from the eastern mass
- [ ] open the mail on the table downstairs
- [ ] do something with my AAA card on the stairs
- [ ] open the mail I have stored in my possessions
- [ ] improve the organization of this document and system; include both a list of goals somewhere and a list of next immediate tasks; make it possible to plan a day with a BA when very confused by sourcing items from this list
- [ ] build & test a small box
- [ ] Find trailer registration
- [ ] consolidate possessions
- [ ] learn about shielded vestibules
- [ ] learn to weld
- [ ] find person to build room for me
- [ ] organize notes for shielding goals somewhere
- [ ] brass used for knife edge on door; how to connect this to wall?

# DONE

######

# Agreements
1. agree upon process
  - discussion proceeds to follow only current topic, which is listed in agenda
2.  first agenda topic is to brainstorm and agree upon initial agenda topics
  - each topic has a priority, 1st priority items always are dealt with before lower priorities
  - 1st priority items are added to agenda with a deadline.  if discussion is incomplete when deadline is hit, item may be readded to agenda for further discussion

= Create Agenda Topics = Priority 1 = Deadlin: 8:20 am
  Time use: 50%
    -> we started late and it is INCREDIBLY hard to get anything done
    -> can we plan our use of tiem better?
  Effort: 100%
  Effectiveness: 60%
    -> there were agenda topics I cared about that were left out
= When Talking Next = Priority 1? = Deadline 8:25 am
  TEE: 100% 100% 100%
= Make Major Tasks/Goals Document = Priority 2 = Deadline 8:40
  TEE: 40% 200% 40%
    -> I spent a lot of time confused during this
      Jim seemed to also be confused
    -> I had strong chest contractions and it was very hard to do this
= Make List of Where to Look for Concerns to Integrate = Priority 2 = Deadline 8:50
  TEE: 70% 80% 100%
    -> I feel this was more successful than planned
    -> maybe could have made it more complex? set goals higher? or used less time?
= CANCELED Brainstorm Agenda for Tomorrow? = Deadline 9:00
= Checking Out at the End = 9:00 - 9:10 =
  TEE: 100% 200% 50%
    -> I struggled here and couldn't meet my mental goals
    -> I left out things I wanted to address
    -> I couldn't hear Jim's expressions well

    -> TEE improvement:
      - rate each timespan something was done during for Time Use, Difficulty, and Effectiveness
      - we want things to have good use of time, low effort engaged, and high effectiveness
      - second half of check-in: celebrate items with good ratios, discuss items with poor ratios
    -> Further thoughts:
      - general check-outs usually just have each person give a general sense of what went well and what went poorly and suggestions for next time, or some variant
      - Karl is often in a state of mind where he can't really generalize or combine information in his mind, so the TEE detail approach is helpful for him, but it is not a good use of time overall
      - Ideas:
      - could check in with Karl, and try TEE approach or try things generally
      - could take some space to calm down, see if Karl's ability to generalize opens up after engaging in some 'therepeutic' behavior like exchanging how we are doing and talking briefly about day
      - Karl also has an issue where his mind goes all wonky when he thinks about certain things among a group of things.  TEE is rote enough that he can try to apply it to all things and keep using it if they make him all wonky.

    TEE: rate time use, difficulty, effectiveness
         missing: wellness of participants
    Jim: what went well, what went poorly, suggestions for improvement


Other Concerns?

  Jim TEE:
    - agenda process, brainstorming, assigning priority, having deadlines means you are using time effectively. we did that. 100% time
    - addressed effort: impressed with me pushing through. feels we were on task 100% effort
    - effectiveness: stumbled a little when we created document, not that effective due to missing on box 50% effectiveness
  Karl feels unsatisfied with regard to including necessary concerns in the process.
  Jim's concerned that we mostly behaved in a rote manner, didn't really integrate meaning of information

Satisfaction regarding: Time Spent, Difficulty-Effort, Effectiveness

Karl:
  TDE not addressed enough.
    I really want to start adjusting things to improve in the face of my difficulty getting senses of stuff.  The only way we began to address this was by moving the old doc into this one -- nothing was actually done with it.
  Success: got through rough spot at beginning! jim took over agenda tracking to my satisfaction which was really freeing!
  suggestion: maybe we could have two meetigns, one to work on _process_ and another to get things _done_ ?

Jim:
  Stuck between 'process' and 'getting things done'.
  Appreciates suggestion above.


concerns:
- merging last document
  subconcerns:

# 2018-11-20 12:32 Jim Taggart mtg
Must end by 1:30

Jim has had sophisticated jobs where productivity is really important, and he's had to design his own
personal systems.  What he's trying to do is help me develop my own productivity system.  Both of us
are not feeling good about the process.  Yesterday Karl yelled at him.  Karl wants to include other
people in the process ... he wants people who are smrter or can type faster; Karl's throwing all these
collaborative interfaces at him and expecting him to use them within five minutes of looking.
Jim's sensing that we're not connecting on how to move forward on this system.
Jim's suggesting that we find on the market a personal productivity system, that is sophisticated,
for me and him to look at it together and see if that might be a better fit than what we're trying
to customize together.

K: It sounds like you're feeling frustrated because this is difficult.  Is that correct?
J: I'm very patient, and I'm not frustrated, but I did wake up last night, concerned about this meeting.
Whatever's happening re personal coaching system, there's tension and anxiety and there's a gap in
communication.  Jim's availed himself a couple of times a day now for a process meeting and a work meeting.

K: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of tension and anxiety around a need for us to communicate and work
more effectively.  Is that right?

J: What would be helpful for me is that at the end of our meetings, that we create an agenda for the next
meeting.  Instead of starting the day with having to create an agenda, we have an agenda from the previous
day for working on the next day.  Do you think we could spend a few minutes trying to create an agenda
for tomorrow morning?

K: <got blocked around typing>


# 2018-11-21 08:14 Work Mtg to 9:15

- [X] Agenda
	-> "personal productivity system"
- [ ] to 9:15 Consolidating Lists

	-> Jim expresses again desire for task priorities:
			1. Next
			2. Later
			3. Extra



	-> Way to associate it with time: schedule, day week month, quarterly?


Next Process Mtg:
- any decisions / goals regarding check-out / check-in / other meeting norms
  => address any decisions or goals regarding the meeting process
    (karl had things he wanted to talk about, change, or stress, or check-in regarding)
- TDE concept (meeting use and goal use)


Next Either Mtg:
- integrating goals / tasks
  -> let's move towards merging UPCOMING list with Present Concerns list

# 2018-12-01 09:18 meeting again to 10:00a
-> concerns:
	- getting back to regular meetings, such that other stuff doesn't get in the way
		-> no deadline, as much as needed, and then reportback if extra
	- reportback
		-> nvc counseling/mediation/friendwork
		-> trip to mass
		-> riley
		-> hiring an organizer?

	- goalwork
		- adding people to the team without clear roles
			- dr mooney's role?
			- nvc counselor
			- kate & jeremy
			- (riley/organizer/gwyn?)
	- what is the purpose?

Jim is a little under the gun and has less time than he may have before, I believe.

Jim feels uncomfortable.  He says that it may cost my father more dollars to meet with both Jeremy and Jim.
Jim is not uncomfortable.  He feels he's not authorized to be paid by my father to join a meeting Jeremy is also paid for.
Jim is going to ask my father about it.  I'd like to also express to him that I feel I gain more from time spent with both
Jeremy and Jim at the same time, than individually, and request that this be authorized.

2018-12-07 10:11a Jim & Kate Mtg
- concerns:
				- organization share:
								- learning from kate regarding experience working with me to get organized
								- status share re: organization
				- keeping up in future
								- schedule
				- jim out of country from 14th through 29th
				  karl traveling home 23rd to 29th, Newton Mass
					14th - 23rd: contact for Karl
- agenda:
								both kate and jim were up with a client last night
								karl also had some up at night
								but it's friday, says jim =)
				10:25
								- jim out of country
												Kate, abstractly, is happy to be point person.  But needs to check in with Windhorse.
												Likely okay for short term while Jim is traveling.
												Jim will check in with Bill; have not specifically discussed this yet.  (May be added expense.)
												Jim will report back to Karl and Kate on Monday.
																Another client will be transitioning out of Windhorse during that timeframe.  It is the only reason there could be a hiccup.
								- schedule next mtg
												Tue 10a

				10:35
								- organization share
								Jim feels we are making progress at becoming aware of Karl's life things.
								Next step: getting things done
								Some progress both fronts.
								Kind of limping re: improving organizational system.  Goal: Karl's self sufficiency.
								Some categories, lists of things, concerns.
								When in person, able to move forward on some responsibilities.  (medical, financial, possession-management)
								Still much work left.
								Impressed with Karl's perseverance.  wants to be more organized, more aware, more productive.
								Jim also has much perseverance.
								Feels better about some of these issues, but system has not really improved to the point of having a groove.
												Karl expresses search for groove that is the search for the groove: an ongoing journey of improving system.
								Jim reports excitement of Karl for things like doing lab reports for degree.

								Day-to-day struggles eat up so much time that it is hard to make serious progress on the things that excite Karl.

								We're talking about methods / strategies, to carve out time for these things.

								Jim would like to get in a groove on making progress on these things.

								re: groove.  Jim likes achievement.  He starts things and puts his whole being into them.  He's not going to give up on Karl.
								He's up for the challenge.  But it can be frustrating at times.
								Good to acknowledge enormity of it.

								Breakthrough yesterday.
								Jim's an achiever.  Building his patience.

								- ideas/open loops:
												- hiring organizer for possessions
												- ttrack system

												- celebrating buildable achievements
												- karl kind of pushed achievement-celebration on jim withotu listening strongly to his place
																-> very inspiring to know jim shares this value for accomplishment
																   ==> perhaps more dialogue around our search for it <==
				10:55
								- check-out
				11:00

2018-12-07 12:02p Jim Process Mtg

2018-
	Jeremy, at 11:27a
		I was going to make an attempt to summarize what I heard Jim say was his perception of part of what might be going on.
		Then I was going to check in with Jim to see if that's accurate.
		Then I was also inviting any part of Karl as best he can to also listen, as best as possible, and an opportunity to reflect
		back to see if it's accurate.
		If Karl doesn't have the capacity to reflect now, he may have this later, and can discuss with Jim.

		What I think I heard from you, Jim, was a thought that because Karl has been in more distress lately, Gwyn has a tendency to
		linger lonegr, and have more difficulty leaving.  Wondering if perhaps this has been actually increasing Karl's distress,
		rather than relieving it.
			Jim: Yes
		Karl, were you able to hear that and maybe reflet back f any part seems accurate to you?
			K: There's some truth to that; I see Gwyn a lot and it can be harder to settle into my own groove of the day.
			   I don't feel it would be fair to blame my current behavior on seeing her so much during these previous days.
			   My guess at why I'm struggling right now would partly be because I have intensely struggled in this environment before.
			   I've noticed that when I have intense experiences, I tend to re-experience them in a prolonged manner when I stay in the environment
			   I had them in.
			   I'm pretty scared around blaming Gwyn for anything when I don't feel my mind is functioning very well, because there are a lot of small
			   things I've been irritated about around hr the past couple days, and I could create a problem due to a confusion in my own mind becoming
			   weirdly large or something.
		...
		While there does, I heard you saying, while there is some truth to having some difficulty with Gwyn staying longer, you feel scared of blaming her,
		and you feel scared that given your current state of mind, some irritations you have might become or seem bigger.  Is that right?

		I wonder if there is a way to try to work with the parts of you that feel scared y this topic ... and if this topic is less scary, maybe it will be
		less triggering to the parts fo you that don't want to talk about anytihng scary.

2018-12-12 11:03a Jim & Kate
	check-in
			Kate just had wonderful -- and meditation for half-hour and -- about -- subjectivity that she really found enriching.

					running a little ragged [rushed to meeting]
					has until 11:45a, has to pick up client at 12:30p in killington, takes 40-45 min

	concerns / thoughts:

		Kate on meditation retreat 2018-12-28 to 2019-01-03.
		Bill authorized any additional billing and agrees Kate is logical person to step in as "point person".
		Jim depicts Kate as doing her regular 2/wk meeting but also being available for any serious matters that came up.
		Kate can do this and has been approved by WH.  Will not produce an additional bill unless time is used.
		Kate calls it crisis coverage.
		Kate says feel free to reach out with logistical issues, such as paying medical bills, too.
		If 10 is crisis, feel free to reach out at 8.
	to 11:40 - addressing karl's behavior situation
	to 11:45 - recap & potential next items
		Jim: feels great to work together all 3, have Kate as a backup
		     appreciates Karl's humor [?]
		Kate: feels sense of connection with both of us.  appreciated call and what we were able to relate to.
			   hopes Jim has wonderful vacation
				 looks forward to stepping into role in Karl's team
				 next mtg with Karl 12/14 10a

2018-12-12 12:04 Dr Mooney
	items:
