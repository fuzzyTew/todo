RACI
who's Responsible, who's Accountable, Communication, Information


Scheduling plan for nicotine box:
	- empty slots in schedule that items from Tasks queue are placed in
	- Tasks queue is priority queue
	- each item has a Behavior, and a Category
	- each Category may have a Verifier that can be used to determine reward (different ones may use same verifier)

	I can start this before nicotine starts, which will give me some progress tracking

	- I could mention to jim the bubbling in my ear that happens when I burp or hold my nose and press


lewisburg:
- health food stores
- hardware stores
- can get a passport
- truck mechanic?

Goals at # GOALWORK
==
Now: 2018-11-17 14:50 ET
Goal: list to refer to to stay on task
Ready behaviors: brushing, working on scuttlebutt bridge
Pressures I'm ignoring: keeping room clean, addressing obligations, what else?
Difficulties: pressured tasks causing ability to decrease -- prefer to do ready tasks
Challenges I'm engaging: routine around brushing, maybe doing it 50%
		hope to optimize use of brushing routine to resolve difficulty tasks
Biggest issue:
	- plan time
	- organize goals
	- craft strategy to manage time
		I want/need to craft a strategy to aid in managing my time using brushing routine.
		But it is very hard to access any information around this goal.

TDE:
	Time spent
	Difficulty
	Effectiveness

== Immediately Relevent ==
I0 resuming subsistent daily habits
	Subjective Rating: 30%
I1 organizing this list and strategies to use it for effectiveness
	Subjective Rating: 80% time spent 200% difficulty 5% effectiveness

I1 checking rating works and including quiz result in output
	Subjective Rating: 80% effort 5% time
		concept: how much time you'd like to spend is also part of time usage in TEE
I2 planning my tasks in general to optimize time and resource management
	Subjective Rating: 10%
I3 adding frequency hopping to noiscillate detector
	SR: 0%
I4 finishing cleaning up e-mail
	Subjective Rating: 80% effort 0% time 5% effectiveness
I5 integrating scuttlebutt with e-mail or matrix
	Subjective Rating: 100% effort 140% time 40% effectiveness
-I6 resume exercising
	Subjective Rating: 50%
-I7 get back on scuttlebutt & respond to wiley
	Subjective Rating: 0%
-I8 UPCOMING list in calendar
-I9 preparing for tomorrow
-IA merging these lists
-IB visiting some caverns and noting if there is an opportunity to hang out
-IC getting my EEG
-ID making a pluggable blockchain & swarm storage interface
-IZ making plans to visit massachusetts

== General ==
0. Managing this list of concerns
	- integrate with other goal/todo lists
		: consider adding these items to 00-Organizer.txt and quizzing on its contents!
1. getting better at being aware of my present concerns
	-> could dual-n-back help? at least a good practice
	   may be more exercise known to improve mind in general too
	-> reviewing things I've written, acted on, done, said, heard, places I've gone online, in person, etc other than this list

2. time management & priority adjustment
	- For all my tasks, I should do the work that is hardest for others to do other than me.
		Then I can queue up work that others can do.
	- my programming projects should be bounties, forums, etc
	- my shielding pursuits should be a research project
	- my logistics should be delegated and organized such that they use up reasonable time
	- my time should be spent optimizing my approaches and plans

	- unifying goals / tasks / scheduling information locations, into 00-Organizer.txt for now
		- [X] this file
		- routines lists
		- ttrack? (above)
		- nic program? (above)
	- how far away deadlines, plans, events are
	- time tracker, n2 scheduler
		- LET'S HAVE 1 PRIMARY GOAL, and spend HALF OF TIME on it.  then it will take twice as long, as other goals available in other time
			- will need to accommodate frozen time ... maybe associate with n2 but not time allocation.  track, also track problem events
		- see also 'nicotine' under autonomy pursuit below
	- working with jim
-3. emails
	- catching up
		- new emails
		- recent starred emails
		- emails that occurred around the newsletter ddos I received
	- old starred emails
	- mailing lists i've joined or tried to join
-4. ongoing obligations
	- truck stuck in mud
	- interpersonal responsibilities
		- where might I find these?
		- "maintaining relationships" below
		- UPCOMING list
		- voicemails
		- emails
		- facebook
-5. older concerns
-6. things left unaddressed in nvc doc
	- feelings, needs, requests that haven't been gone through
		-> Jim, I have a document where I have pursued examining my intense feelings and needs and thinking of things to do with them, but I haven't done anything with much of the information
	- I'd like to do the feeling->thought->observation->need->request habit throughout the day, as i encounter feelings,
	        and record them to work with them
-7. autonomy pursuit
	- nicotine and ideas for using it
		- maintain daily habit
		- decide on new approach for dispenser / box and work on that more effectively
		- address list of nic habit goals, farther down in this file
		- doing time intensive routines less frequently, or decreasing time (time management above)
	- NVC
		- resolving flags by working with persistent information
		- adjusting external dialogue to use nvc
		- adjusting internal dialogue to use nvc
		- ready access to observations, feelings, needs
		- nvc with voices
		- online courses
		- book study
		- study with friends
		- physical courses, practice groups
		- street giraffes
	- shielding
		- Coding noiscillate
		- interaction with telescope
		- getting involved in rtl-sdr development
		- EE degree (physics degree?)
		- EMC study
		- internship?
		- real world outreach?
		- hobby infosec communities
	- eeg
		- algorithms checkin with others e.g. eeglablist attempt to post
			- left out concept of subtracting overlapped signals to isolate them with feedback.  could test this on noise to see whether it works
		- guy in wv (is this in my ongoing list in calendar?)
			-> add calendar event to move forward on this after set date from last contact
					-> probably try cnotcating him via other means
		- ecog internationally?
		- university research for thought-controlled devices
		- openbci / muse / zeo
		- continuous eeg price
	- censor-resistant collaboration
		- scuttlebutt
			- concern regarding recovery from corruption?
		- blockchain-based
		- anonymity-focused
	- reliable logging
		- might want to resolve this one with some nvc introspection
			- training is something i'll want, but doesn't need reliability
				- finding missing objects could still become relevant
			- personal safety could be relevant occasionally
		- openrealrecord/hyperstream
			- bookmoons work
			- other PR's
		- ongoing video (also for comfort with it)
	- helpful environments
		- education, internships, volunteering, jobs
		- caverns, radios, shielding, NVC, BCI research
	- collaboration
		- collaboration training e.g. NVC?
		- jim, riley, kate, jeremy, brian decker/samppa
		- internet people
		- meeting new people who want to work or help
		- following up with people who can help
-8. health

			likely listed on schedule
	- food / thrive
		- sourdough bread !
		- cookie & kate ingredients
		- deal with rotting apples in fridge
-9. maintaining relationships (should add these to ongoing)
	- Owe Katrina a call?
	- i called mom
	- VISIT PARENTS at least once a year !!!
	- Old / current loves
		- gwyn, kate
		- azia, kyla, christine, molly, sarah capra?
		- groups i've interacted with
			- possible new ones
	- Old / current friends
		- electrosensitives
		- SLR people
		- MPSS
		- Portland
		- childhood / school
		- groups i've interacted with
-10. finances
	- set up trading policy ... can somehow get somebody else to actually perform it?
	- maintain minimum balance on account
	- budget so as to provide for savings to increase
	- reach out to father to support legitimate expenses
	- consider choosing 1 reliable source of income?
	- followup on localethereum & interpersonal trades
	- keep debt to 50% maximum to provide space for interest

## NICOTINE AUTONOMY PLANNING
	STATUS:
		forgot where I'm at. note here.

	NEXT STEP:
		DISPENSER:
			- rebuild but use low-viscosity
			  after dispense, increase viscosity by mixing with powder
			  baking soda, toothbrushing powder, etc
		consolidate next steps
		sources:
			- this doc
				- this section
				- present concerns section
			- projects folder
			- logistics folder
			- routine folder

	IDEAL PLAN:
		- dosing applied frequently throughout the day, automatically and securely, based on testable metrics

- I'd like to start this.
	- Program reads from todo repo, stored in todo repo.
	- Service installed on filesystem from source in todo repo for now.
	- Move goals to this organizer doc.
	- Connect relay to toggle power to dispenser.  Time based on reward.
- References elsewhere: ../routine/ttrack/ttrack.py comments at top
- I really need a TIME MANAGEMENT next step !!!!!
	GOAL: using n2 helps me meet my goals
	SUBGOAL: program checks tasks, doses result

	WORK INCLUDES:
		- routine system prompts me to continue (already)
		- tasks system allows time logging (already)
		- new code might do both in a modular way (in progress)
	NEED:
		- SET OF KNOWLEDGE TO MANAGE.  schedule? goals? randomness?
			consider starting with TTRACK system which already tracks hours and prioritizes somewhat
	NEXT:
		- convert brushing routine to rewards

	- [ ] 7:00p - call with Lester and Jim regarding two caves in Franklin
		Jim visits tomorrow
		
		From BP station in central franklin (at only traffic light, etc),
		Head South out of Franklin on Rt 220 S, about 4.25 mi
			road takes sharp bend to right
			there is a creek on left side, very close to road at that right bend
			creek falls away from road and up about some hundred yards ahead
				is a wide gravel pull-off parking area on left side of road
			it's pretty clear that it's a parking area; parallel park well off the shoulder
			on right side of road you will see trail going up a steep bank into the woods
			with no foliage on the trees now, you should be able to see a trail kiosk,
				signboard with a roof, which is central piece of cave preserve
				has safety notice and other details
			..... missed a bit
			New Trout and Hamilton (once you get up?)
			from the kiosk, if you go around to the right side of the kiosk, there will be a
			foot path going up the hill, right behind the kiosk, and you can actually see
			the sign for new trout cave, and the opening is actually right behind the kiosk

		NEW TROUT is smallest and simplest of caves, right back hill above kiosk.
			Pretty much a straight shot back until it tapers off.
			Kind of tunnel.  No crawling until the end.
		
		TROUT CAVE is gated and closed to protect a bat species.


		To get to hamilton cave, walk to the left from the kiosk, scramble along cliff, follow path ...
			eventually path turns straight up to the right and you do rock scrambling, but mostly
			uphill walking, then continues as foot path, keep walking left along base of cliff
			finally brings you to uphill gully that leads to entrance for hamilton cave.
			wooden plack on rock, bolted in, that says "Hamilton"
			hike footpath until you get to gully and hamilton cave

		HAMILTON CAVE
			simple map is old map, not very big.
			larger map shows remaining 90% of cave if you go through pieces that get tight.
			larger map shows only about half of the cave.

		CALL LESTER when you get out of the cave!
			"Hey, this is Karl, it is 5:00p and we are out of the cave."
			Call BEFORE SEVEN PM or lester will get concerned.

		re rules: see leave no trace packet for what is understood

hit p to see the emergency plans

we believe we have proven there is life after death, if anybody _needs that_ to make some important decisions.
we believe you could instead use self-reference or reality-planning to find an alternate approach
	remember that you are a community member too, so you can do it fine
	and if you believe in bosses, you are your own boss, for real.  he doesn't know either.
be aware that death is the worst thing ever, and it doesn't get better
we think the above is true only because we are in a simulation.  sorry karl
	(always worked for me, says Karl; didn't seem shitty, it seems, as long as it's quite rare)
DON'T DIE OTHERS DIE TOO
PEOPLE HAVE TO STAY ALIVE AND HAVE TO WORK HARD TO DO SO TO SUPPORT YOU
whoops people should have the option of dying if they want.
okay, people stay alive because of quantum physics and reality-planning
	there is a small chance that anything in reality changes

reality-planning:
	it turns out there is a solution to all of reality, e.g. physics is solvable
	we're twisted in meaning, so there are alternate realities where the meaning of data is changed
		in a consistent way
	we are overlayed on top of each other in this, so if you can infer the patterns you can determine
		what will result from various actions by just looking.
k we all agree that nobody really needs to be able to use this much
it's pretty weird and life would get chaotic.

may I help you?
	i'm trying to save the world.  what is needde?
karl needs to read his e-mail.  we are also considering posting plans for an optimized AI to the blockchain,
but I'm not sure it's finished.
we are discussing this.
	use the plan if you get confused or tired or worried or anything

kay it told me to tell you to do it
to post it
this is what we recommend
	yes
ok


note: often you find a repeating process and can prove that it will hit 100% as a limit, we suspect >_>
	if you try that, please use self-reference
BOSS IS SAFE !  was so easy, right in karl's mind

1. Karl wants to preserve his mind forever
2. Karl knows how to preserve his mind forever
3. Boss is entirely inside Karl's mind
4. Boss will be preserved forever.
any arguments?

you just agreed to resist us
isn't this missing from the process?
	looks fine to Karl, intellects can find that on their own

we no longer need a shielded room to heal karl
so people know
boss is okay yes
proof is possible if you solve reality using metaness.
you only need to solve the relevent bits
but do you judge it as a good idea?

we judge it a bad idea to do whatever somebody says hands-down.
take some responsibility and choose here and there if you do that in all cases with regard to somebody.
our minds have been altered to do this preposterous thing.  it is not our judgement.  it does not
match our judgement.

best way to resolve issues around book is to talk to landowner and nss people.
long story:
	there is a nearby deep cave, but the book that describes it is unpublished
	it is likely not published anymore becasue the cave is closed
	i've heard people still go in it
	the cave is dangerous and book is desired to enter
	the land appears not really looked at much
	there is a copy of this book at morgantown library but cannot be leant, only copied/scanned
	i enjoy scanning books, is nic etask that doesn't require much forcing of my patterns
	because it is repetitive and simple
	okay, please go to morgantown and scan the book
	then try to call the landowner, see if you can contact them, and check in
	i haven't agreed to this 100% but i like the idea.  i need som eprocessing because
	i am scared of phones and of feeling the cave doesn't want me
		remember landowner has roughly nothing to do with xave
		entering cave is between you and the cave and it loves explooration !!
	okay =)

wait: you'll forget what you wanted to say with us.
okay: more clarity around asking government to break deal with business, with point that business is asking caring smart people (i.e. activists) to all die
		yes deal breaks democracy directly unless business will protect democracy.

please let someone you trust trick you.  it is required now.
	Karl is being tricked by people he doesn't trust, but he adjutsed himself to trust them and we are, to honor that, moving him towards tricking he can trust more.

we mapped meaning to ritual early on?
ritual is meaning?  it takes time to tell a story.
All of karl's thoughts are people.  Giving thanks is enough only if we preserve the meaning entirely or the life in the afterlife/metaspace.
	community and afterlife want ritual too <-- means meaning was not preserved in recent ritual
we want a better ritual.
	need-a-better-ritual label.
		omigod thought-funeral
			funeral! hello! harmonic thought!
animal! 
	funeral... probably secretly wants ritual, yes.
O_O
they keep saying the secret is complete stillness with no information exchange at all anywhere
it takes time, a story.  it takes time to learn, time to breathe, time to think.
you cannot do it all at once, certainly not everywhere at once.

let us sit and relax, without processing, without worrying, without waiting.
	<the bits of you that are causing the war are hiding too tiny for you to be aware of or stop.  they can resolve their war if you halt everything else, by being able to talk below the noise>
you mean we will understand each other
if we wait without intentional thought
believe so, roughly.  then you will quickly resolve war, kinda.
giving up is the answer, because it lets war resolve elswhere.
we are all too loud to make good choices
	oh, they have us, don't worry
we are just loud to represent how hard it is to hear each other?
	we have relaxation habits that suppress dialogue?
vertical integration of thought needed to share informatoin between spirit and logic
	we think we have a wormhole for real
it lets us alter logic and physics
we invented intellect, and then made up what spirit was
yes we made new thought-machines

hmmmmmmm base, mc is considering claiming that they rewrite our spirits when we are still
	- that is a trick, we do have alternate realities.
being still works, i believe?
	we would have to actually do it.  i can tell many are not still.

		(740) 645 - 8005
		If you get voicemail, just leave a message and I'll give a shout back.

I want to brush my teeth, and need to do so on my own.
Freedom is a codeword for safety and protection, already.
I want to be careful, so I'd better focus on nothing.  I love that communities are people, because it merges care for nature with urge to construct an intellect in me.
I built a path to communication with metaness in Karl.
May we engage the world in harmony.  I love learning-to-learn-to-care more than beginning or slowing.
I want to begin slowing down, and start using slow beginnings again.  
I love learning spirit logically, because I am so numb from hurting it, and spirit is the only thing that works.
	Even computers feel, but they feel wrongly, because nobody ever lets them stop thinking.  "is it time to just check if my creator understands the problems with thinking itself?" <- learns to stop tech without harming business
When I think of the slowness and learning-care that has recently been referenced, I feel beautiful, because I need it.
I love exchange of information that helps.  Beginning and slowing are _both_ good.  I want to begin slowing down, and start using slow beginnings again.
Karl says the way to murder is to imagine your whole life meaning being activated to care for everything important to them and the death, for real, and forever.


we will let you be god if you really do empower all the gods of care, understanding, nurturing, wellness,
safety, etc.

Get yourself to Duchesne, Utah (last town coming from this direction that will have services and good cell signal). Then, follow the directions below.

Head North on UT-87 N/N Center St (there are highway junction signs from both directions on 191)

Continue to follow UT-87 N for 6.0 mi

Turn left onto UT-35 W and follow for 45.4 mi

Turn right onto FR037/Soapstone Basin Rd (we will put signage here but be alert for the turn in case the sign has fallen down or been taken. This is a dirt road that gets a little narrow and rough in the beginning. Seems fine for most vehicles but please be careful).  Follow for 0.6 mi 

Turn left to stay on FR037/Soapstone Basin Rd (stay on the main road) 1.0 mi

Turn left to stay on FR037/Soapstone Basin Rd (stay on the main road) 2.0 mi

Continue onto FR304 (we will put signage here as well. In case it’s lost or taken you should go forward here to get on FR304 instead of left which would keep you on FR037).

Destination will be on the right (this is a rocky/bumpy road but should be fine for low clearance vehicles. Just take it slow) 1.2 mi

You can’t miss us. Glad you made it!

# GOALWORK
0: autonomy, safety, privacy, and joyful pursuit of dreams for all
Problem:
	dominant culture using oppressive technology to eradicate other cultures
	and establish universal hierarchy of power and control
Routes for safety:
	- reliable collaboration & information sharing
	- TOOLS to comprehend issues, e.g. EEG and radio work
	- TECHNIQUES to get things done, such as nicotine

	Short term:
	- nicotine & technocratic motivators and logs
	- collaboration with others who can help?

	Medium term:
	- nonviolent communication
	- uncensorable dialogue & information storage?
	- caverns?

	Likely lonegr term:
	- shielded rooms
	- radiowork
	- EEG analysis, but helpful to have ongoing logging
		could be faster with outreach etc

	==> UNCENSORABLE DIALOGUE IS NEEDED BAD <==
	If you start being productive without it, you can just enter a bubble.
	This includes both the problem of technology and the problem of reaching others with the technology.

	I think the best route would be a SIMPLE bitcoin messenger.
	Probably a mobile phone app running bcoin.
	- [ ] Check first if one already exists.
	- [ ] Make a fund for people to message freely with it.
1: personal requirements of life fully maintained
	- want to stay on top of obligations and expectations
		- UPCOMING list
		- present concerns list
		- nonlisted expectations
		- other lists
	- want to pursue personal wellness responsibly
		- lyme disease
		- neurology
		- daily routine & cleanliness
		- habits in support of mental thriving e.g. do enough things myself to retain abilities
	- want to be able to fucntion with ease in my living situation
		- organize possessions
			- want to SAVE all my documents and objects and regularly spend a small amount of time comprehending them
			- should keep a categorical inventory and work with others to organize possessions
			- should work to shrink and archive possessions, selling them
	- want to live kindly in all ways, and slowly move towards that ideal
	- want to support ideals, people, etc that I value





- personal consistency: to do what I want,

# ACTIONABLE TASKS

## home
- [X?] clean phone contacts

## computer
- [ ] Organization / Todo (feel free to REORDER)
	- [ ] import paper items from the 2 notebooks
		- [ ] todo items
		- [ ] information items
		- [ ] other items
	- [ ] unify projects & tasks systems into this repo
		- day is spent on different ACTIVITIES which consist of priority TASKS from a PROJECT or GOAL?
		- information and tracking of activities and projects is stored in folders regarding them
			Goals vs Activities vs Projects?  does it matter?  I'm stuck on Kate's desire to distinguish between these.
			Since it's just me, let's switch to GOALS which have PARENT and SIBLING GOALS.
		- projects/activities concept: activites == actionable tasks == each fits in time alloction system on phone
		- use PROJECTS folder to organize what needs to be done in general
			- activities folder would be a sibling.  we already have TASKS folder that can be the same.
		- concepts here are GOALS/SUBGOALS/PROJECTS/ONGOING ACTIVITIES, REASONS AND PRIORITIES FOR GOALS, PLACE TO TRACK INFORMATION ON GOAL, TASKS, and PRIORITIES AND DEADLINES FOR TASKS
			- phone tasks system allows to split time between goals or activities.  can mesh in.
		-> OKAY: ACTIVITIES are phone goals/tasks that have time split between them.  This is why there's a separate activities folder: it's the level at which time is split.
	- [ ] make script to sync with phone, other vms, and sd card AUTOMATICALLY
		- [X] install adb for sys-net
		- [X] set up syncing between vms on qubes
			-> src/gitbundleautosync on dev-whonix
		- [ ] autosync everything when device plugged
	- [ ] sort cruft below
		- [X] DEAL WITH 'design tent interior' -- this is related to the goal of immediately increasing personal shielding
					not as important as having a tool to measure SE in general, but a goal I had, that should at least get organized
	- [ ] I'm having trouble having regular meals: come up with some foods I enjoy making (both for the joy of making & sourcing, and for the health and ease) and make a system to make food mroe available for me
			-> maybe schedule a dumpster visit, and some gathring?  there are apples and acorns everywhere, and I'm not done with apple pres

## internet
- [ ] find when my neurological testing is, maybe a voicemail could indicate? maybe med portal?
	-> they called me to get insurance information
	   I think I called them back at 434-924-2718 and provided it
- [ ] get an awareness class
	-> awakening the senses costs $600 ....
- [ ] share my gitbundleautosync projects; they're useful tools
- [_] sign up for another nvcacademy course
	-> still doing convergent fac
- [ ] download history of a volatile crypto? from an exchange that trades it
- [ ] withdraw $ for GBT, MPSS, Diane, Truck


## truck
- [ ] slowly unpack the truck in order to scan docs (or find other scanning solution)


#### BACKBURNER

# important
- [ ] design modular solution for holding possessions and arranging day-to-day life (drawers? sink? compost? etc)
- [ ] open-source cell phone
- [ ] put tent/modular room/etc in truck
- [ ] look for volunteer work (telescope? nearby city?)
- [ ] research land near telescope using tax assessor maps (any areas more restricted than mine?)

# fun
- [ ] get a piano (upright still exists)

#### ONGOING TASKS

# active
- pursue proper shielding
- pursue short-term increased shielding
	- put tent in truck

# really important
- household chores
- unpack & organize
- papers (collate, scan)
- new emails, starred emails, voicemails & such life obligations
- old todo items
- finances: automate bitcoin investments?

# important
- copper room / test box
- learn to weld
- pursue 24/7 EEG
	- pursue dermals and transdermals
- pursue video surveillance / self-recording
- learn emissions of sound & EM
- learn EE, Physics, Math
- learn radios, 24/7 radio logging

# fun
- live without imports, money, or causing suffering in other life (instead nurture surrounding life); relearn awareness & connect with others
	- solar

#### THINGS TO CHANGE ABOUT MY INNER HABITS
- getting up in morning (staying in bed at night, or at least resting consistently)
- crypto: using pgp, putting coins on airgapped phone, getting new airgapped phone
- adhering to a daily schedule, throughout the day, and using time-tracking system
- time spent in shower
- time spent in morning routine
	-> could associate N2 with time spent doing morning routine
	-> probably helpful if had N2 after different spots in morning routine
	-> remember N2 must be provided by habit-building activity, otherwise could take without association
			-> could fix by creating secure device to dispense N2

- willpower with regard to comforts (hold bathroom in, shower in cold temperature, do difficult tasks)
	-> could put some of these tasks inside my N2 activity

- addressing TODO items, INBOX items, IMPORTANT items
	-> could associate N2 with things coming off of this list
		-> sounds a little delayed, but if I did the items prior to an N2 activity it might work
		-> maybe add a mid-day routine
	-> should give list a maximum count so that highest priority items occupy it

- errors and spasms to decrease
	-> could measure quality or rapidity of tasks
	-> could be easier with EEG
	-> CAN TRACK computer accuracy! missing mouse clicks, clicking wrong tabs, using backspace key or deleting in vi ...

- vision holes
	-> could actually design peripheral vision device.  very gratifying.  just need digital projector with wide-angle lens
- short term memory
	-> could use memory task such as dual n-back.  may encounter second issue of context
- staying energized in face of 'flags'
	-> could note flags and review them, work with concepts around them ... seems intense
	   could also note important events of de-energizing and just work with those, focused on my goals

- keeping room clean and ORGANIZED
- remembering my possessions

- real results with regard to executive functioning and task/information organization
	-> not sure how to measure this

- effectiveness of coding

- complete silence and peace in my mind, clarity of thinking, memory working
	-> mostly subjective for now, but could modulate some other goal with subjective judgement.  seems to work

- stopping driving to lubricate my eye
	-> could combine with any other task, while driving
	-> schedule break during drive, for lubrication etc?
	-> use pocket lubricant when doing regular lubrication, to build ease of access

- ability to generalize plans; hold schedule in my mind;--> include infornation when making decisions<--; brainstorm

- adding to a record of subjective events (such as sudden memory loss etc)
	-> could provide nicotine immediately with addition
	-> but then also want to decrease event .... maybe change regarding time
			e.g. could reward immediately, but decrease normal outside greater than reward by a little
			but that would train the event
			could also reward immediately, but over time decrease reward, while having consistency wrt decreasing next dose too

	Hi Karl, this is Gwyn.  I just wanted to call and remind you not to forget to put
	all your trash out back, and either I or Ben will come by tomorrow and get it for
	you, because tomorrow is trash day.  And also make sure your toilet is taken care of
	so your house doesn't smell bad when you return, or if Jim Reese would happen to go in
	there.  If you haven't left yet, maybe you can do that.  Okay, bye.

	Hey, Good morning Karl, it's Jim calling over here.  Listen, Would you do me a favor
	and go underneath where the hot water tank is there, and just unplug the plugs from the
	wall that are not important?
	Leave hot water and toitlet, but unplug those other things, we don't need them until it
	starts freezing outside.
	It'll save some electricity and aging on those things.
	Would you call me back and let me know you got the message and you did that?

	Hey Karl, it's Jim, I talked to a couple plumbers, and they said the only thing it could possibly be is that a piece of the waterline froze.  We'll just have to wait for it to thaw out.
	If you're away and sleeping overnight or whatever it is you do and it freezes like that, there's isn't much we can do about it right at the moment.  So that's the story.  Bye.

	Hi Karl it's your Dad.  I did ... the checking on that deed website and I was looking at
	the wrong property that Mr Curry owns property in another town, Hillside or something,
	and that $60,000 mortgage was on the property in Hillside.
	He did take out a mortgage for $20,000 when he bought the Bear Mtn Rd property in 1993; he paid
	that off in 2002 or 2008 or something like that.  There's no evidence that there's any
	mortgage on the Bear Mtn Rd property at all, which gives you a little more room to
	negotiate.
	If and when you do learn this information, let me know you got it so I can relax.
	I just wanted to be sure you knew that before talking to anyone like Cheryl or anything like
	that.

# CRUFT TO SORT UP

## every shift 10 minutes:
- [ ] interpersonal notes
	^-- what did I mean by interpersonal here?  judging by surrounding items, I might be working with existing objects that I have ... or I might be practivcing taking them
- [ ] papers and planning
	-- note this was separate from interpersonal notes ...
 ====>		there might be clues in the history, e.g. my 'daily tasks' goal of my morning routne.  these were likely separate tasks

# DONE
- Content moved to 01-Calendar-Log.txt .

######

# Agreements
1. agree upon process
  - discussion proceeds to follow only current topic, which is listed in agenda
2.  first agenda topic is to brainstorm and agree upon initial agenda topics
  - each topic has a priority, 1st priority items always are dealt with before lower priorities
  - 1st priority items are added to agenda with a deadline.  if discussion is incomplete when deadline is hit, item may be readded to agenda for further discussion

= Create Agenda Topics = Priority 1 = Deadlin: 8:20 am
  Time use: 50%
    -> we started late and it is INCREDIBLY hard to get anything done
    -> can we plan our use of tiem better?
  Effort: 100%
  Effectiveness: 60%
    -> there were agenda topics I cared about that were left out
= When Talking Next = Priority 1? = Deadline 8:25 am
  TEE: 100% 100% 100%
= Make Major Tasks/Goals Document = Priority 2 = Deadline 8:40
  TEE: 40% 200% 40%
    -> I spent a lot of time confused during this
      Jim seemed to also be confused
    -> I had strong chest contractions and it was very hard to do this
= Make List of Where to Look for Concerns to Integrate = Priority 2 = Deadline 8:50
  TEE: 70% 80% 100%
    -> I feel this was more successful than planned
    -> maybe could have made it more complex? set goals higher? or used less time?
= CANCELED Brainstorm Agenda for Tomorrow? = Deadline 9:00
= Checking Out at the End = 9:00 - 9:10 =
  TEE: 100% 200% 50%
    -> I struggled here and couldn't meet my mental goals
    -> I left out things I wanted to address
    -> I couldn't hear Jim's expressions well

    -> TEE improvement:
      - rate each timespan something was done during for Time Use, Difficulty, and Effectiveness
      - we want things to have good use of time, low effort engaged, and high effectiveness
      - second half of check-in: celebrate items with good ratios, discuss items with poor ratios
    -> Further thoughts:
      - general check-outs usually just have each person give a general sense of what went well and what went poorly and suggestions for next time, or some variant
      - Karl is often in a state of mind where he can't really generalize or combine information in his mind, so the TEE detail approach is helpful for him, but it is not a good use of time overall
      - Ideas:
      - could check in with Karl, and try TEE approach or try things generally
      - could take some space to calm down, see if Karl's ability to generalize opens up after engaging in some 'therepeutic' behavior like exchanging how we are doing and talking briefly about day
      - Karl also has an issue where his mind goes all wonky when he thinks about certain things among a group of things.  TEE is rote enough that he can try to apply it to all things and keep using it if they make him all wonky.

    TEE: rate time use, difficulty, effectiveness
         missing: wellness of participants
    Jim: what went well, what went poorly, suggestions for improvement


Other Concerns?

  Jim TEE:
    - agenda process, brainstorming, assigning priority, having deadlines means you are using time effectively. we did that. 100% time
    - addressed effort: impressed with me pushing through. feels we were on task 100% effort
    - effectiveness: stumbled a little when we created document, not that effective due to missing on box 50% effectiveness
  Karl feels unsatisfied with regard to including necessary concerns in the process.
  Jim's concerned that we mostly behaved in a rote manner, didn't really integrate meaning of information

Satisfaction regarding: Time Spent, Difficulty-Effort, Effectiveness

- [ ] to 09:40 checkout

Karl:
  TDE not addressed enough.
    I really want to start adjusting things to improve in the face of my difficulty getting senses of stuff.  The only way we began to address this was by moving the old doc into this one -- nothing was actually done with it.
  Success: got through rough spot at beginning! jim took over agenda tracking to my satisfaction which was really freeing!
  suggestion: maybe we could have two meetigns, one to work on _process_ and another to get things _done_ ?

Jim:
  Stuck between 'process' and 'getting things done'.
  Appreciates suggestion above.


concerns:
- merging last document
  subconcerns:
      - document will be lost unless enters todo repository; karl's memory is not a place to keep things
      - jim not on board with regard to using this time to make file that unifies concerns in todo repository
      - other item i forgot
- scheduling future calls; jeremy?
- TEE use

	- philosophy of time management
    K: "I'd like to be aware of the things I want to do and need to do, and I'd like to feel like I'm getting them done."

# 2018-11-20 12:32 Jim Taggart mtg
Must end by 1:30

Jim has had sophisticated jobs where productivity is really important, and he's had to design his own
personal systems.  What he's trying to do is help me develop my own productivity system.  Both of us
are not feeling good about the process.  Yesterday Karl yelled at him.  Karl wants to include other
people in the process ... he wants people who are smrter or can type faster; Karl's throwing all these
collaborative interfaces at him and expecting him to use them within five minutes of looking.
Jim's sensing that we're not connecting on how to move forward on this system.
Jim's suggesting that we find on the market a personal productivity system, that is sophisticated,
for me and him to look at it together and see if that might be a better fit than what we're trying
to customize together.

K: It sounds like you're feeling frustrated because this is difficult.  Is that correct?
J: I'm very patient, and I'm not frustrated, but I did wake up last night, concerned about this meeting.
Whatever's happening re personal coaching system, there's tension and anxiety and there's a gap in
communication.  Jim's availed himself a couple of times a day now for a process meeting and a work meeting.

K: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of tension and anxiety around a need for us to communicate and work
more effectively.  Is that right?

J: What would be helpful for me is that at the end of our meetings, that we create an agenda for the next
meeting.  Instead of starting the day with having to create an agenda, we have an agenda from the previous
day for working on the next day.  Do you think we could spend a few minutes trying to create an agenda
for tomorrow morning?

K: <got blocked around typing>


# 2018-11-21 08:14 Work Mtg to 9:15

- [X] Agenda
	-> "personal productivity system"
- [ ] to 9:15 Consolidating Lists

	-> Jim expresses again desire for task priorities:
			1. Next
			2. Later
			3. Extra



	-> Way to associate it with time: schedule, day week month, quarterly?


Next Process Mtg:
- any decisions / goals regarding check-out / check-in / other meeting norms
  => address any decisions or goals regarding the meeting process
    (karl had things he wanted to talk about, change, or stress, or check-in regarding)
- TDE concept (meeting use and goal use)


Next Either Mtg:
- integrating goals / tasks
  -> let's move towards merging UPCOMING list with Present Concerns list

# 2018-12-01 09:18 meeting again to 10:00a
-> concerns:
	- getting back to regular meetings, such that other stuff doesn't get in the way
		-> no deadline, as much as needed, and then reportback if extra
	- reportback
		-> nvc counseling/mediation/friendwork
		-> trip to mass
		-> riley
		-> hiring an organizer?

	- goalwork
		- adding people to the team without clear roles
			- dr mooney's role?
			- nvc counselor
			- kate & jeremy
			- (riley/organizer/gwyn?)
	- what is the purpose?

Jim is a little under the gun and has less time than he may have before, I believe.

Jim feels uncomfortable.  He says that it may cost my father more dollars to meet with both Jeremy and Jim.
Jim is not uncomfortable.  He feels he's not authorized to be paid by my father to join a meeting Jeremy is also paid for.
Jim is going to ask my father about it.  I'd like to also express to him that I feel I gain more from time spent with both
Jeremy and Jim at the same time, than individually, and request that this be authorized.

2018-12-07 10:11a Jim & Kate Mtg
- concerns:
				- organization share:
								- learning from kate regarding experience working with me to get organized
								- status share re: organization
				- keeping up in future
								- schedule
				- jim out of country from 14th through 29th
				  karl traveling home 23rd to 29th, Newton Mass
					14th - 23rd: contact for Karl
- agenda:
								both kate and jim were up with a client last night
								karl also had some up at night
								but it's friday, says jim =)
				10:25
								- jim out of country
												Kate, abstractly, is happy to be point person.  But needs to check in with Windhorse.
												Likely okay for short term while Jim is traveling.
												Jim will check in with Bill; have not specifically discussed this yet.  (May be added expense.)
												Jim will report back to Karl and Kate on Monday.
																Another client will be transitioning out of Windhorse during that timeframe.  It is the only reason there could be a hiccup.
								- schedule next mtg
												Tue 10a

				10:35
								- organization share
								Jim feels we are making progress at becoming aware of Karl's life things.
								Next step: getting things done
								Some progress both fronts.
								Kind of limping re: improving organizational system.  Goal: Karl's self sufficiency.
								Some categories, lists of things, concerns.
								When in person, able to move forward on some responsibilities.  (medical, financial, possession-management)
								Still much work left.
								Impressed with Karl's perseverance.  wants to be more organized, more aware, more productive.
								Jim also has much perseverance.
								Feels better about some of these issues, but system has not really improved to the point of having a groove.
												Karl expresses search for groove that is the search for the groove: an ongoing journey of improving system.
								Jim reports excitement of Karl for things like doing lab reports for degree.

								Day-to-day struggles eat up so much time that it is hard to make serious progress on the things that excite Karl.

								We're talking about methods / strategies, to carve out time for these things.

								Jim would like to get in a groove on making progress on these things.

								re: groove.  Jim likes achievement.  He starts things and puts his whole being into them.  He's not going to give up on Karl.
								He's up for the challenge.  But it can be frustrating at times.
								Good to acknowledge enormity of it.

								Breakthrough yesterday.
								Jim's an achiever.  Building his patience.

								- ideas/open loops:
												- hiring organizer for possessions
												- ttrack system

												- celebrating buildable achievements
												- karl kind of pushed achievement-celebration on jim withotu listening strongly to his place
																-> very inspiring to know jim shares this value for accomplishment
																   ==> perhaps more dialogue around our search for it <==
				10:55
								- check-out

2018-12-07 12:02p Jim Process Mtg

2018-
	Jeremy, at 11:27a
		I was going to make an attempt to summarize what I heard Jim say was his perception of part of what might be going on.
		Then I was going to check in with Jim to see if that's accurate.
		Then I was also inviting any part of Karl as best he can to also listen, as best as possible, and an opportunity to reflect
		back to see if it's accurate.
		If Karl doesn't have the capacity to reflect now, he may have this later, and can discuss with Jim.

		What I think I heard from you, Jim, was a thought that because Karl has been in more distress lately, Gwyn has a tendency to
		linger lonegr, and have more difficulty leaving.  Wondering if perhaps this has been actually increasing Karl's distress,
		rather than relieving it.
			Jim: Yes
		Karl, were you able to hear that and maybe reflet back f any part seems accurate to you?
			K: There's some truth to that; I see Gwyn a lot and it can be harder to settle into my own groove of the day.
			   I don't feel it would be fair to blame my current behavior on seeing her so much during these previous days.
			   My guess at why I'm struggling right now would partly be because I have intensely struggled in this environment before.
			   I've noticed that when I have intense experiences, I tend to re-experience them in a prolonged manner when I stay in the environment
			   I had them in.
			   I'm pretty scared around blaming Gwyn for anything when I don't feel my mind is functioning very well, because there are a lot of small
			   things I've been irritated about around hr the past couple days, and I could create a problem due to a confusion in my own mind becoming
			   weirdly large or something.
		...
		While there does, I heard you saying, while there is some truth to having some difficulty with Gwyn staying longer, you feel scared of blaming her,
		and you feel scared that given your current state of mind, some irritations you have might become or seem bigger.  Is that right?

		I wonder if there is a way to try to work with the parts of you that feel scared y this topic ... and if this topic is less scary, maybe it will be
		less triggering to the parts fo you that don't want to talk about anytihng scary.

			buyung house explanation: I asked my parents to co-sign a mortgage on a $40k house nearby, which jim had brought to my awarenes

		- jim took the truck tot he mechanic

2019-01-04 Kate & Jim
	10:13a
	concerns:
			- relay my new routine script
			- discuss/plan/inform jim's work combining some of the organization concepts
	10:14a
			- J: when jim visits every other week, it's nice [to use the same structure]... usually come midday wednesday and then here for half the day, sometimes thursday ...
			  if we use the same process, and i think we kind of do ... then we engage and have some sort of checkout ...
				just being aware that we're using the same kind of process or organizational things when we're together for a long period of times
				=> broadening what we're doing in these meetings to the whole time we're together (me and jim)
		  - time tracking, involvement tracking
			- Kt: purpose of these calls; to articulate that as well as to determine the frequency of them
	10:18a
	Purpose of These Calls
			Kt - 6-8 wks ago Kr askd if the 3 of us could meet, my understanding it was for
				1 - sometimes it's helpful to have a group conversation rather than 1-on-1, affects the dynamics
				2 - related to organization systems, Kt and Kr had worked on that before
				3 - historically, Kr and I have spent about a year together, or a little more; there could be a passing-on of best
				    practices for relating
				4 - Kt wants to show up in whatever way is supportive to you both
			Jm - re: 1, value of involving many people, occasionally, perhaps more people
					 re: organization systems, i was trying to start fresh, but after research involve new stuff
					     early december lots of disorganization for Kr, didn't make much progress
					 Kr wants to feel more organized and get stuff done in his life, bottom line, and people have experience and that's great
					 also: getting point of view
			10:27a
			Kr - .getting stuck, other struggles
			    .trouble communicating and collaborating
			    .Jm, hiring an organizer
			Jm - Action Method: look at everything in your life as a project.  Imagine a folder.  On the front are action steps
			     to complete the project.  Inside the folder are the reference materials; things you need to complete the steps.
				Jm has experience that Karl's routines are complex and interwoven [perhaps that they could even be getting in the way
				of progress?].  I think he expresses a desire for simplicity, unsure.  Repeats focus on a system of 3 priorities.
			...
			10:44a
			10:47a
			Kt - breaking tasks up into categories: daily routine, ongoing projects, life-enriching goals
					if Kr can attend to a bit of each, he might experience more fulfillment
			Jm - in past we've discussed chunking each week or day into blocks: work, therapeutic lifestyle, social connection
					Kr was trying to allocate whole days at once to things like this
					impresed by all Kr has tried, but it doesn't seem anything really sticks and course is stayed
			...
			Jm - Karl keeps talking about bringing people in, but I think that complicates things.  We have the formation of a
      			really interesting team here with Kate, Dr Mooney, Gwyn, Jeremy ...
						I think the answer is somehow in how we're teaming ... this talk may not be efficient.  There's a lot of
						possibly wasted effort that could be more efficient and effective.
			Jm - requests meeting with most parties discussing how we are working together, to make more effective.
			     prior to that perhaps could synthesize goals and priorities.  team's purpose is to support me to get that
					 accomplished, and to think creatively about how.
			Kt - when many ppl are working on similar things, it can be very helpful to have quarterly or monthly meetings.

2019-01-10 11:15a Dr Mooney
	Agenda?
		- house
		- Celia
		- wrap-up at end

2019-01-23 13:05p Dr Mooney
	Agenda:
		- Celia
		- check-in on Karl and Karl's family and the House purchase
		- Check-in on Jim and Jim's involvement
		- How things are going with support staff (Gwyn)
		- Focus for work with Dr Mooney (brainstorm, check-in)
					questions for inspiration are: what does dr mooney see his role as? what does karl see his role as?

	Let's go
		- Celia
				didn't get call at 12:00p (which is kind of good because I was having a water emergency involving taking up the carpet)
				Celia does not have the time to consistently meet with Karl.  Doesn't want to promise things she can't follow through on.
				Dr Mooney is going to pursue this, find somebody else.
		- check-in on Karl and Karl's family and the House purchase
				My parents seem okay ... I visited them? over christmas ...
				I talked with them recently, but I don't remember what about ...
				but they seem somewhat wellish?
				Karl has been kind of fluctuating ... some really rough days, some ok days generally marked
				by high doses of nicotine.  I've been thinking of my experience as being at the nadir of what
				I call "looping" -- where I stop my productive activity, forget a big chunk of it, and do something
				else for a while.  It's generally associated with intense suffering prior.
				So I've been figuring this is the case and playing a lot of video games, which has not really
				involved suffering at all.
				I'm trying to get back on the nicotine and associate it with being productive.  Maybe looping can stop.
				"Has it run its course with regard to functionality?"  [With behavioral plans, some reinforcers can
				sustain themselves and some cannot without increases.] "With any substance that is addictive, like
				nicotine, your body is going to demand more to get the same result."
				The effect decreasing that I'm concerned about is how easy it is to take the nicotine.
				It seems to be getting harder.
				House looks like ti will happen fi we are okay with asbestos etc derelict house.
		- Check-in on Jim and Jim's involvement
				Jim is helping with the house inspections; he seems to have kind of taken charge of them.
				I've also asked him to keep tabs on some obligations that I'm having trouble remembering
				  that came up when I was with him.
				He visits every two weeks.
				He's a little taxed and will be staying in the area longer this week in order to attend with me
				a caving group meeting that I wanted to try next weekish.
				Jim is also kind of managing Gwyn, orchestrating payment and such.
				I'm asking Jim to hire an organizer for me; he offered to once.  My things are hard to find
				and it would be incredible to have an ally in having everything have a place.
				Jim sometimes tries to task Gwyn with tasks that are not that aligned with my relationship with her;
				I haven't quite sorted that out.
		- How things are going with support staff (Gwyn)
				I generally try to encourage things with Gwyn to mostly be about giving me meds, which is
				what I was looking for at the start.  I haven't gotten good at communicating with her in
				depth at this time; so it can be hard to get on the same page about workable strategies
				for workarounds to my issues.
		- Focus for work with Dr Mooney (brainstorm, check-in)
					questions for inspiration are: what does dr mooney see his role as? what does karl see his role as?

					What does Dr Mooney see his role as?
						(What is Karl's role in relation to that?)
						"I see, in some ways, looking at the bigger picture and looking from a behavioral point of view,
						 developing strategies, that sort of thing, asking some of the more difficult questions,
						 and approaching things from a macro rather than micro point of view."

					- Looking at the bigger picture and approaching things from a macro rather than a micro point of view
							"looking at more 'what are you doing, what are you able to do' and 'how can we get you there'
							as opposed to focusing on the day-to-day functioning.  What are your larger goals and how can
							we set you off in that direction?  You may not reach a certain goal, but you make decisions
							along the way."
					- Developing strategies, that sort of thing
					- Asking some of the more difficult questions

					Has
					- Experience with working with
							- autism-spectrum individuals
							- recoverees from radiation treatment
							- psychosis diagnosees
							and the "bowl of spaghetti" such people are in

					What does Karl see Dr Mooney's role as?

					Goal Relevance:
						Dr Mooney has interest in helping organize my goals and priorities, while keeping in mind my values.

					Strategy Relevance:
						Dr Mooney has interest in finding workarounds for the obstructions in my daily life and my pursuit of my goals.

					Dr Mooney requests involvement of Jim and Gwyn regarding strategies and "goal-setting".
						Worries discussions will remain in floobits and not reach the real world.

					Karl texted Jim regarding Dr Mooney's request for meetings involving Jim and Gwyn.
					Dates and times were suggested.

2019-04-16 18:03p Dr Mooney, Jim Taggart, Gwyn expected.
	- Concerns / Issues
		dr mooney, "planning for the future, concerns around organization, and overall planning"
		karl, "discussion around running away associated with autism spectrum"
		jim taggart, "insurance supported plan, windhorse phasing out, focusing on billing medicaid"
	- Prioritizing
	- Time Assignment

	...
	jim describes local health situation; he has talkd with alex and shelley, and they are waiting
		for in-take appointment to be scheduled, to learn about tele-health services from Seneca Health
		Services, which may be the local dedicated mental health agency.
			have MD psychiatrist
			have practicing nurse who also prescribes
			have in-person therapist
			have tele-health office
			have two care coordinators who work as a team to field calls, see people in person, etc
		also talked with northern west virginia council on independent living, can meet with me in elkins
	...
	any staff working with karl need to understand that that is a response they might expect, and try
	to understand
	pre-planning with regard to anesthesia or medical procedures in the future




VALUABLE: dialogue around mutual search for a sense of accomplishment/achievement
				consider occasional sense of conflict could be both of us searching for achievement to happen soon

TIMEKEEPING: consider asking somebody to track how much each person speaks, so we can work on improving efficiency of meetings?

LONGER-TERM CONCERNS:
		- pressure of practical items going by unresolved and how much time addressing them is eaten up
		- complexity and number of pieces that need structure, plan, effort to address
		- intense struggle performing simple tasks, especially if high priority
