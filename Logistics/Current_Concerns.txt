0. Managing this list of concerns
	- integrate with other goal/todo lists
		: consider adding these items to 00-Organizer.txt and quizzing on its contents!
1. getting better at being aware of my present concerns
	-> could dual-n-back help? at least a good practice
	   may be more exercise known to improve mind in general too
	-> reviewing things I've written, acted on, done, said, heard, places I've gone online, in person, etc other than this list
2. time management
	- unifying goals / tasks / scheduling information locations, into 00-Organizer.txt for now
