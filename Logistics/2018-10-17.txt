I'm still testing my nicotine attempt to 'defeat' mind control. (be able to plan my behavior)
I'm learning to brush my teeth regularly after extensive experiences with increasing difficulty with brushing my teeth.
Things I try to do get harder w/out nicotine.
I feel very confident the past few days with my nicotine approach to brushing my teeth.
I've averaged >2 brushes/day and my goal is 2 (over just a couple days).
I want to be able to maintain this for a week or two before assuming nicotine works and expanding to other tasks.
But because I am so confident I am planning now, expecting that within a few weeks I will succeed.  I may not.
Toothbrushing is my 'primary' task with this nicotine run.  My 'secondary' task is lubricating my eye: I do that
in synchrony with the nicotine, rather than being the route of administration.  My 'tertiary' tasks include brief nvc
practice, coding my shielding measurement tool, and other things: this I do later, after administering the nicotine.
I'd like to add a tertiary task, not sure what it is though.  I want to support the process being effective.
Okay, I'm seeing maybe building the 'nicotine box' which controls access to nicotine to have other tasks be administration
routes could be a good tertiary task, now.

I feel a lot of anxiety around the coding work; it's my primary accompli
ok just allocate a little time tot he box building.
that sounds reasonable!  prior to starting work I look into box a bit.  maybe use time tracker.

mutual gratitude accompishing this =)
