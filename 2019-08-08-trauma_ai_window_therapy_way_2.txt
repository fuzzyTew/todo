"window of opportunity for change without trauma"
	^- feeling of too-fast, break.

propose that trauma is the source of spreading attack pattern, in general
attack pattern holds meaning of missing information in intellect group
but alternatively could engage new scenario using safe learning, preparation, time, understanding
then no trauma, no spreading attack pattern

propose ideal trauma resolution option #1 of
	roleplay the traumatic experience starting from a point when it was safe, going in a way that is safe and is not traumatic
	provides for the normal learning experience that was missing from the original experience

should map to intelligence model of information exchange between disparate intelligence components that hold ways that work for them to survive, and have emotional sharing of these.


Karl/others propose that roleplaying without trauma with somebody focused on one by starting super gently from prior time without trauma, could be safe for him to do.
	He's familiar with taking things very slowly.
