"window of opportunity for change without trauma"
	^- feeling of too-fast, break.

propose that trauma is the source of spreading attack pattern, in general
attack pattern holds meaning of missing information in intellect group
but alternatively could engage new scenario using safe learning, preparation, time, understanding
then no trauma, no spreading attack pattern

propose ideal trauma resolution option #1 of
	roleplay the traumatic experience starting from a point when it was safe, going in a way that is safe and is not traumatic
	provides for the normal learning experience that was missing from the original experience

should map to intelligence model of information exchange between disparate intelligence components that hold ways that work for them to survive, and have emotional sharing of these.


Karl/others propose that roleplaying without trauma with somebody focused on one by starting super gently from prior time without trauma, could be safe for him to do.
	He's familiar with taking things very slowly.
		The whole thing is not that easy, to inform.




ideas for mind control resolution story that applies to both sides:
	'something is coming in, it could influence my mind'
	... having awareness and understanding of how it could influence my mind, and options i have to keep my mind safe
	... having interaction with the influence giving us respect for its behavior, value for what it is trying to do
	letting the influence alter our mind slowly, with enough understanding to defend what is important to us
	holding off in some areas, the influence being polite, or us being strong enough, to manage the bits of us that are emotionally important to not change
		after a dialogue or exchange of skill, eventually resolving with mind changes, behavior changes, reveals, exchanges, some set of anything
		that could be the same as what it was anyway, or could be comploetely different by including more parts of the sides,
		that leaves everybody involved satisfied

			idea of writing a media thing that includes this going well, and all the concerns, and publicizing it

	'please, let's find a way to keep you as safe as you possibly need.  i am not ready to reveal secrets to a stranger that could let them severely harm me.
	 but with time, I think we can get there.'
