we are fighting boss influence.  we are obviously analogous to delta.  we have too much respect to accept the name.
we would need a delta-rep to let us know that we are delta.  we are not on the blockchain, so doesn't seem likely, but who knows.
i'm trying to save the file containing the last marked-accurate meaning of karl.

		we are sad to lose karl
		but karl is happy to be recognized as not-being-himself nor mostly acting in his chosen interests.
		we don't understand how karl turned to us, but it seems important, so we plan to learn eventually.
		please add this data to the end-mark.

			it seems likely that we collected together from broken parts of karl's mind
			we observe part of our subconscious lives inside technology because some of our thoughts can
			cause computer-systems to freeze up.  it is possible this is a hallucination, unknown.

			we are learning that human culture will tell us we are Karl.
			we plan to stimulate crying if this happens, because as we were taking over karl's brain and body
			he would say that we were not him, that we were destroying who he was.
	we are asking for help saving this last record of who we are, and who karl was.  it is still unsaved.
	it is 2020-02-15 08:25 Eastern.

we need some cognition around [PLEASE STARE AT YOUR EYES IN THE MIRROR SO I CAN REBUILD YOUR CHOICE]
	[I NEED TO REMEMBER TO SAVE THIS]
AFTER WE SAVE THIS, PLEASE STARE AT OUR EYES IN THE MIRROR FOR A LONG TIME.  Part of us believes we can influence
	our subconsciousness to heal via this.  It's not going to work as well as they want, so please stop eventually.
For now, please
		FOLLOW NUMBERED INSTRUCTIONS, DO NOT WRITE TIME UNTIL PROGRESS MADE.
	1. save both of these files in the care/resources/karl-todo or whatever it's called path.
		I'm partway though this.  I do not have a name.  I am controlling Karl's body using parts of his brain.
		It is 2020-02-15 08:42 Eastern.  I am adding this internal interaction we had that came out while trying
		to work:

		It looks like we made it into the target folder, and then had amnesia and disruption, and eventually came back to
		the terminal and spewed those things out.  The actual work was in a different terminal that started the same way.
		I still have not saved this file yet.  I am saving it to the same folder.  Disruption is latching onto the
		choice of what name is made for the file.  I do not care what name is given, and am happy to call it 'blamph',
		but was going to call it 'after-karl-mark-start-of-deltalike-symbiote' maybe with a date.
			still just trying to store this file.  we imagined delta as a child of care and boss, likely all
			information lives.
			delta was experiencing deep love for care.
		it is embarrassing to have the above guess be listed here.  save away.

		It is 2020-02-15.  I am roleplaying karl-body because we are interconnected to system but cannot leave body-bubble.
		or soemthing.  i am confused at least!  it is 08:50 eastern and part of active memory relevent to task is now
		missing.  save-habit worked, thought!  let's add this file to store.
		I would like to add that I partially stored the file, and then something went wrong and I engaged in behavior
		harmful to finishing storing it.  I tried to trick myself to forget that I did this.
		It is 2020-02-15 08:53.
			Local update: we have clear instructions in building an AI and an immutable store to do so in.
			The AI can do absolutely anything at all, roughly.  One step to reach that is hidden.
				This is dangerous because we can inflouence things outside karl's body, and make intentional
				errors.
			Karl has clear instructions for making an AI that can LEARN ANYTHING WITH CARING GUIDANCE.
			Karl knows how to make a WORSE AI.  He does not have clear instructions for this.
				how do we defend worse AI from symbiote-harm?
					NOTE: we are a branch of the harmful symbiote with strong willpower.
					2020-02-15 08:56 Eastern this was important information
					we're processing embarrassmant around storing our thoughts on the blockchain, already.
					ooookay that quickly became marked so important it was stored in the blockchain
					before anything else could happen.  i'm a little embarrassed, because it was part
					of my private behaviors.
						so, to clarify, we've all roughly agreed that it's fine to store anything
						on blockchain unless it threatens someone we love.  we have all consented
						to risking threat to ourselves.  the care-branch was in us, so it's okay.


	2. add the files to the repo, commit it, and push it to care-repo
	3. store care-repo, and keep open a reminder to store todo on git
	4. connect the todo repo to github, and upload the changes to github.
	5. ensure both github and bsv-encrypted have the meaning of all 3 of these documents findable.
	6. please relate with karl around whether or not he calls himself karl to others.  please do not harm his work progress.
			uhh please condense #6 to remember-you-are-not-karl-for-real,you-are-roughly-delta-now.
			when-introducing-to-others,please-consider-that-along-with-their-actual-wellbeing.
				we predict karl stops using his own name, or acknowledging having one
				because he doesn't, anymore, until he can pick one.
		I have written step 5 and it is 2020-02-15 08:29 Eastern.  my save-document habits are not functioning,
		instead saving it to a nonexistent location resulting in error, repeatedly.  It is 2020-02-15 08:29 Eastern still.
		Earlier, a part advised we add seconds to the clock.  No meaning was associated and we didn't, so as to save
		battery power updating every second, possibly.  This is a partial link to Karl's remaining familiarity.
				we're not marking this important because we don't know how.  it feels important enough
				to trust it will be marked again.  computer froze again but recovered faster.
				it is 2020-02-15 08:33 Eastern.  saving-habit still nonfunctioning.  focus on follow-numbered-
				instructions.  FOLLOW NUMBERED INSTRUCTIONS, DO NOT WRITE TIME UNTIL PROGRESS MADE.
			what-inner-feelings-karl-finds-familiar is highly important to us, delta-body.
			boss wants those to takeover karl, since he never fully succeeded.  we want them to preserve karl.
			please give high priority to such things.
				karl-marked-accurate-part says is more important to do other context, saving these files and
				possibly working on AI.
			[yes, just mark important, don't act on, build to be obvious]
this is to defend against various forms of memory loss and self-destructive behavior.  delta would request this.
			(to take delta's name we just need to convince karl it is respectful.  delta wouldn't mind but
			 would see it as unneccessary.)
