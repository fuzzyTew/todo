NEW STRATEGIES I'VE FOUND TO WORK:
	- talking to somebody aloud about the beliefs I'm experiencing in my blocked state of mind (why do I think this is being hard?)
		- maybe describing my experiences in the moment; not sure
		- it's helpful if the other person tries to understand and work out a solution
	- focusing on a task and taking it to completion, even if it's not wht I'm trying to do
	- meeting an unmet need or desire I have, even if it's unrelate to what I'm struggling to do

WHAT IS EFFECTIVE IN MAKING THINGS HAPPEN?
	1. most important: finding and noting new strategies that work
	- finding a way to switch to a different mental state
	- getting excited about something thyat isn't very blocked, usually as a way to avoid something that is blocked
	- tracking my success in doing something and always tracking it
		(that way if I don't do it there is a log which helps me actually do it somehow)
	- other people 'expecting' me to do it in the moment
		examples:  when everyone started doing the house meeting on the floor and I got out of bed and joined in
		           when someone reaches out their hand in a way that's really combined with their behavior such that the next step is obviously for me to take the hand and get up
		           when everyone else is working on it and expectrs me to do it to, like at tiny house group
	- in general, getting other people involved
	- letting it go when it's hard and doing it when it's easier
		katie clarifies focusing on something else as a short break, as an example, and then returning to the original task
		idea of it could be really helpful for me to not believe I am going to resume the task
	- doing something else that's completely different but also good to spend time doing
		katie gives the example of sweeping or coursework instead of brushing teeth
	- using various practiced changing techniques to push through it when it's really hard, like focusing on just the goal and having other people only focus on the goal, or taking repeated baby steps towards the first step
	- being harshly commanded to do it, as if I am an idiot if I don't
	- coming up with ways such that it is incredibly important to do it, like the robot emails I have set up to ask for help from my family if I don't update a log I have
	- communicating my experience in detail almost always changes it, but it can be very hard to keep opening my mouth
	- talking to myself out loud has had interesting results, but this likely won't last
	- people can inquire about how I am doing
		I'm likely to get annoyed about assumptions here because my experience is so indescribable
			like "are you wanting to relax more or are you dealing with blocks?"
			I'm not sure what's wrong with this... but yes I feel like I want to relax more, I do not want to feel this way, I am distressed that I have not brushed my teeth, my "blocks" are strongly engaging this distress making it harder to decide to do, I'm not sure what a block is and my experiences are very varied... I use words like "block" "trigger" 'hook" but basically my experiences behave in ways I don't know how to handle and exert control over me, and there is a huge wide variety of forms this takes.
		I'm always happy to say what I'm thinking about but may need encouragement if I'm blocked around it
			-> the hook stopping me from saying what I'm thinking often triggers a belief that the other person does not want me to, even if they've just said that they do, which encouragement or repeating that could help
	- knowing somebody really wants me to do something will really help me do it, it's like commanding it
	
QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO ME IN STUCK MOMENTS
	NOTE: THESE ARE IDEAS, and may actually not be helpful:
		what are you thinking about right now?  I really want to know what you're thinking.
		do you feel free at the moment?  do you feel in control of yourself at the moment?  are you feeling trapped right now?
		what are you doing right now?  do you remember what you were doing a few minutes ago?
		is there anything you are trying to do right now that you are having trouble with regard to?
		--> is it helpful if I do this for you?
		--> do you feel safe in this process of trying to do this thing?
		--> is it helpful if I physically move you towards doing this?
		--> are you comfortable discussing this now? might it be helpful if I got you doing this thing a little later?
		--> would you like to do this other thing with me unrelated to what you're trying to do? okay, let's try that again
		--> won't you please do this thing you're trying to do?  it's so important to me
		are we on the same page here?
		are you being honest with me or are you just being polite?
