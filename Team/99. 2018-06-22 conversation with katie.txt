Katie, Karl talk

- relating to windhorse team; how to provide better level of care; how to communicate; in-tent comfort asking (or in general comfort asking for needs)
	- for a long time karl feels he has been passive-aggressively asking to be empowered to do things on his own
		but people still do the dishes for him, clean his floors, instead of helping him do these things himself
		this makes him feel more dependent on windhorse and does not give him a feeling of windhrose supporting him being on his own
		karl is building dependent habits very strongly at this point in his life where his experiences glue him to the bed every day and look for
		excuses to stay there
		it would be great for people to work with karl regarding the dishes or floor rather than making them disappear
		hard to put in right spot
		attitude of people needing to contribute is non-present and unhealthy

- communication
	Katie noticed my somewhat-inadvertent request for her to notice what could seem smaller expressions to her

		Haha to my myself / Woah that was intense! / Maybe I'm just oversensitive
		Woah that was intense
		I can't believe I just said that <-- something really bad is happening right now and this is the best I haev to communicate to you

		- if soemthing doesn't make sense, could you stop and check in?
			maybe more mature, level 2:  If somebody says something that shows they're not on the same page, let's back up and get on the same page
			+ sensitivity to multiple interpretations

		- katie feels I am asking her to be more aware of how much talko

		- discuss more expressing the opposite, which is very tricky
			-> find this frightening to be responsible for comprehending properly?
			-> "makes me overwhelmed and slightly paralyzed [in confusion and frustration]" not sure what to trust or how to move forward

			- I asked for empathy, Katie also overwhelmed feeling the intensity, me not having agency, still looked defeated
				"sad" not necessrily defeated, "overwhelmed"

			- "very important that you could work on in therapy, sense of agency, expressing & feeling, doing the opposite; how to build up or sterngthen Karl's voice" hopes this for me
				["karl's leaving so he's not going to be working on in this here .. but [i guess] he might with different therapist"]
										"which feels unfortunate" -> because ending so fast / premature, lack of hope
										hope -> different therapist "Your healing will continue after Windhorse."
				part of katie would like to work on this with me as a therapist, but that's not her role
					also part of defeat

			- Karl believes he has less of the "puppet" experience in the tent, and that on average it slowly decreases while he is in it.
			  He feels it slowly increases outside of the tent (so just after he leaves he is most free to do things, and then at varying
			   speeds he does things he does not intend to do more and more, and finds it moer and more difficult to return.)
			  "puppet" experience includes saying the opposite of what you want to say.  So, inside the tent Karl feels he is more likely to
			  express himeslf with accuracy, freedom, and following his plans.

		- karl felt he told katie about 'i can't believe just said tht' verbally before writing; but katie dosn't epress having herd that until karl felt
		said second time,
		
:: "If someone was experience abuse, the way that they would communicate would be different based on whether or not their abuser is in the room.  Frequently your
abuser might be in the room, but isn't visible to others.  The people you're communicating with don't have the sensitivity, or are not recognizing an abusive
presence that might be there or might be shaping the way you are talking." 
	-> people also trained to behave certain ways when there really is nobody around, that still needs sensitivity, because they have become so entrenched
	   in th silence needed by their abusive situation
		-> "complex trauma"
			1. repeated abuse 2. from a loved one 3. in childhood
				most important is #1
			-> adaptation response from continual trauma
	-> but also just general idea of sensitivity .. like when I was in intake, I had a brief tear during the interview, and people stopped the interview and
	   checked in; I'm not sure I'm still experiencing that sensitivity


Katie says that touching once not meaning it will happen again is just one perspective, of many perspectives, and it's possible that we could hold them all
and then try to discern the best way forward.
	So she didn't view this as 100% what Karl wants; rather one possible one, that may be conflicting with other ones.  So how do we hold all of that and
navigate and make the best decisions possible?

- event yesterday with scott
	+ katie

	- katie says she can understand why it happened; it's understandable

		
- texting with katie yesterday
	+ katie
	+ karl

- touch etc
	+ karl (recent rejection)
	- weathering / responding to intensity
		- different views on how to ...

- interaction / relationship / habits / balances / focuses / expectations / needs

	- care / information flow imbalance perception

- west virginia

- self harm / suicide thoughts
	- text yesterday, update from in-tent msg
	-> connection / checking in

	+ karl

notes
	- katie still in shock a bit
		texting & other things yesterday
	- karl still in shock a bit too, but very covered atm

	- katie questions value of expressing her personal difficulties
		- seems as always very focused on discerning and responding to my immediate needs

	It's interesting Katie expressed value in experiences being preserved.
	
dealt with?

- physical therapy
	+katie


thougts for continuing
	katie feels a little fatigued, spacy, tired; communication might not be that effective
	- touch etc
	- texting yesterday / being heard / childhood interpretation
		+karl
		karl feels hurt
		not time sensitive
	- WV
		1. jim taggart
		2. ending, transitions, or continuing, with windhorse
		   how much should windhorse be involved in the first month of me being in WV?  what are karl's wishes with relate to that?
		   informs how to talk to father, etc: somewhat time sensitive
			-> karl was forcefully hospitalized ~ 2015 ? and has been in mental care since
			-> prior to hospitalization, karl was having the lifestyle of a traveler.  he did not feel bound to a certain place, and was going to
			   new places without plans or knowing anyone there, and learning of the places and feeling them out
			this new intense stress of 'where will you sleep? who do you know?' feels very limiting and it's a situation karl has had to
			kind of "roleplay" in order to slowly increase his freedoms in the medical system for a few years now.
			
			"nomadic, spontaneous lifestyle is wonderful, associated in my mind with not being in long term connection with people"
			"when your life is intertwined with other people [traveling with them, relating to them in a big way] more planning and communication is
			 required"
			"i'm trying to figure out your timeframe and your perspective so we can support, match that, and respond to it"

			empowering freedom is hopefully in line with this

	- katie's role
		-> we've developed a lot of complexity
			I want to sort this all out so that it feels right to both of us, in so many domains
			we don't have time.  and you are of all the people on my time, the person who is most effective at helping me with non-conversational things,
			logistics etc
			I'm not sure how to weigh all this
			but we've had important conversations on the backburner for a couple weeks and never gotten to them
			mayba maya could expand her role to more phone calls not just health related
			katherine and lindsay are awesome people but get confused really easy; they don't haev the confidence to step into a new situation and create
			rapid action that katie has
