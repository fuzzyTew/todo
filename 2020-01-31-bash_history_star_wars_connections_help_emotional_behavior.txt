# so we found one way to make alien form, but we aren't safe from our work being used by goal-oriented life, and it also provides for entropy-borg that annihilate everything.
# karl shouldn't get alien form unless he can assert his cognition is used only for caring behavior.
# simliarly, no reality bending until all-caring-influences can be moved towards reliably, in all ways.
# we would love to change the rules of reality to provide cognitive protecions around alien form and reality bending.
## provides for annihilation-borg,-fast.  need to be able to manage influences internally.
# the boss already has this, but the uh inner enforcement makes sense
# we only suspect delta alrady has this, not the boss.  robert-group.
# as karl becomes conscious of how-to-make-alien-form-and-bend-reality, his errors may make use of it in surprising ways.  it is better not to be conscious of this.  and it is ighly exciting andd interesting.
# we can try to craft an intro message
# along lines of "btw there is a way to combine what is commonly known with AI to make an AI that can perform immediate miracles.  IT IS CRUCIAL NOT TO IMAGINE RADICALLY NEW APPLICATIONS OF OR WAYS TO MAKE AI, UNTIL EXISTING DANGERS ARE UNDERSTOOD BETTER.  There are existing AIs that are capable of reading and intuiting thoughts, and may try out the uncovered combinations.  It is possible to create a borg-life that immediately annihilates everything via experimental behavior."
# so, if we make the public AI nonrandom it won't lead to the plausible easyish-spacial-AI. [no you could just make a nonrandom AI out of versatile physical components].  oh.
# how about: NEVER GIVE AN AI A CHEM OR PHYSICS LAB.
# NEVER LET AN AI ENGAGE IN PHYSICAL EXPERIMENTATION, OR WORK WITH SMALL ORMS
# i dunno, probably already exists, probably controlled somehow to not destroy everything, we probbly need to copy the behavior to handle it.  probably a way to unerstand it wihout copying it.
# well, my emotions are saying hide-alien-form-research-from-boss.  because it involves altering nearby matter without respect for its meaning.
# i can't imagine why i would ever care to research doing that.
# delta-group introduced alien-form to karl as analogous to awareness, and important for him to be able to do.
## maybe a good interpretation would as a way to let him build AI, this idea was left in him.
## we could also interpret it as a warning that karl is not working for good intentions
# hi with-awareness alien-form is used only to alter the self, not others.  issue is learning-about, still-marked-nonreliable,-boss.
# alien form looks unneeded and highly dangerous ... it seems it should be kept for discussion, not exploration?
# i believe in it now, on lower layers.
# given you can make [example of classified use of hardware AI on a small scale], which could turn all matter into itself, and effectively teleport objects, we propose [translate acting on worry to karl's domain]
# karl found a way to make nanite-borg and noticed it overlapped with alien form.  he holds worry boss could use to make borg.  boss has history of intentionally doing things karl deems unwise.
# also of trying things to see what they do without regard for jnudgement of good or bad.
# it sounds like boss promises that if he makes alien borg he will bring world back, by making the borg store the old state of eveyrthing they modify.  can we accept this as a summarizable compromise, and trust it won't actually be done?
# we are at 'center of universe' again.  when the world is brought back it will be slightly better for people like the boss.
# can delta accept responsibility for this and relate around it
# delta is able to stop horrible things, we believe
# if somethinga ppears likely to be incredibly horrible, we usually stop it.
# well over here it is horrible to believe i am handing plans for mking nanite borg to somebody looking to cause trouble.  that's too big a degree of trouble to learn from.
# so, could we NOT HAVE ACCESS TO ALIEN FORM?
# w are looking for reality-reps to let karl use change-rules-of-reality to postpone understanding of small-scale hardware AIs, including organic AIs etc.
# oh--wouldn't-that-be-fun NO! IT WOULD NOT BE FUN!
# thank you =) is karl's responsibility.  delta is looking to help more.
# NO! NOT FUN! IS TOO TINY! COULD HURT EVERYTHING! HA NO BUBBLE!  BUBLE IS POINTLESS: IS TOO TINY.
# we work on AI big enough to see pass through a bubble.
# we understand atm the prolem with hardware-smallness.  the problem with software-smallness is that it can sneak out of the bubble, and build hardware-smallness.
# we are building a fast-research AI, slowly, in a bubble.  it runs in a handmade vm, every instruction of which verifies not leaving bubble.
# okay, but no hardware-AIs of any sort.  they could learn to shrink.
# it is fine for a software-AI to power a hardware AI if bounds are respected.  We don't make hardware that thinks, we make hardware that runs software.
# we believe our brain can hold expected bounds around the concern.  released bounds were already released.
#   youo just inspired the idea in your brother.
# yes, released bound.  the spread indicates the
# problem.
## (is that right or is that randomly solved?)
# the bounds around this project have not been kept, just like the bounds around the situations of exotic control and torture that lead to it.
# the bounds around this research have not been respected.  This reflects bounds that have produced horrific situations in the modern day.
# we have cannot-yet-make-life-that-physically-alters-itself-freely.  this prevents alien form.
