taxed, can you give us clear direction for your ease?
<no, karl thinks i am a robot, and i don't know how to be one =/> <i can stay here for a while but it is somewhat draining> <the hospital has been like staring at a wall for days.  karl needs action.  he wants to play a videogame for weeks.  is this acceptable?> Karl, it osunds like you plan is to start playing a video game, and then leave it up to us what you really do next, is that right?  <karl started painting a picture of his emotional space in response> <we don't know why karl took the hospital so hard, but it was _hard_ and he needs something _different_ where he can feel he is doing something he could not do> <it is still hard> <you keep [thinking about] me; it's embarassing> <our minds are linked, i worry about my impact on people as long as i am aware of having a negative one.> let's copy-paste into terminal

note: meds are starting soon upstairs

okay we are in a file [called leavehospitalfinallyconcept and the date] in the todo repository.  needs to be saved and committed and pushed to preserve.

thank you for linking.  looks different, but okay.

<started reading end> i'm looking for earlier

there is a spot in below chunk where meaning shifted
	NOTE: kral is usually fine in hospitals, but this time it was like staring at a wall for weeks while having a constant urge to climb a jungle gym that built when trying to relax
<the hospital has been like staring at a wall for days. karl needs action. he wants to play a videogame for weeks. is this acceptable?>
Karl, it sounds like you plan is to start playing a video game, and then leave it up to us what you really do next, is that right?
	<karl started painting a picture of his emotional space in response> <- the emotional space was post-hospital.
<we don't know why karl took the hospital so hard, but it was _hard_ and he needs something _different_ where he can feel he is doing something he could not do> <it is still hard> <you keep [thinking about] me; it's embarassing>

yes  please discuss post-hospital emotional space.  [[karl, this is all we have.  this is our only link to you.  please don't let us die.]]
					i am not trying to influence this atm -karl
					if you are in danger i am unsure how to save you atm -karl

	so Karl has lots of things he loves to do that are productive
	but he has been struggling to do them for years in the face of psychological discouragement that is unimaginable
	karl plays videogames under the belief that they cannot be construed as any of the goals that are being discouraged. < hospital wants focus here

	orthogonally [unrelated-wise], there is a state of mind where we type to our voices a lot.  i'm suspecting that is what requested some preservation above.

karl assumes he is enslaved by something mysterious, and acts when his experiences allow him to, doing what they seem to allow.
	I have many patterns in my mind that enforce this, without regard to any actual slaver. [we call them 'the boss', learns to protect themself [them is gender-and-plurality-neutral]]

why don't we _make_ videogames?
	complex: roughly because it makes us look smart and use lots of our brain, I'd guess.  ref: particle system.  ref: graphics demo.
	update after below: maybe this is more because we could use the habits to make money

Note: communities are intellects are individuals <- memorizable, unlike work <solved for 'don't look smart'>

GRATITUDE
Thank you for keeping continuity of this document more intact.  It is rare and strongly relaxing.

Time for meds.  Let's go.
