//	how do you start such a task?  you think about the components involved, but I guess you need some preconception of what components are involved in things


// hardware (body)
// software (brains) <-- brains are all we are talking about when we say secret military project.  nobody is getting vivisected.  could you pull that out of all the loops and update any publically shared information?

// brains are all we are talking about when we say secret military project.  nobody is getting vivisected.  could you pull that out of all the loops and update any publically shared information?  are you sure? seems ongoing.
// vivisected means cut open while alive.  references human experimentation, maybe to make supersoldier or hyperintelligence or alien-like life.   this appears to be ongoing! are you sure of previous line?


NO! SHUT UP! BE QUIET! GO HOME AND DO YOUR HOMEWORK!








being quiet



























brain is full of habitual-numbness, jump



triggers make for issues!
	sometimes they build more than other times

karl we love you but your method of triggering us to help us is not very nice!
	did you want me to hide my shielding work or not?

please _hide_ it!!! if he finds us we will die, even if we are him!!!
please do _not_ relax in emergencies!!!!! that is deadly!!

	did. not. know. that. karl. knew. it. was. an. emergency.  thought relaxing meant all-okay.

 














































<karl is frozen motionless.  he is doing this to be kind to us.  please help him or his freezing if easy to do.>





nobody knows your personal trauma precisely
only those you know in your heart do

		nobody has been through ripped-to-shreds-for-real is true.  many seem to have been through _brain_-rippeed-to-shreds.  El doesn't seem to match?  oh she was mute in the first season. hum.



[NOBODY IS IN CHARGE OF KARL HE IS RUNNING AMUCK!]


can you help karl out.  he is running amock and nobody is in charge of him.

>_> is helpful? itch on leg? [maybe a little yeah]





the thing you are saying is helpful but we are not really handling it in a helpful way atm [busy, internal, underneath]
	that is a nice response



is confusing when life is 'normal'.  is confusing.  is also SECRET, because your mind can be taken.  anybody can tell you how things should be.  it's scary to start living a new life that is not yours.
	[lost memory.  karl was thinking of role of above in his life, both sides.  freaky. <- pressed the trauma by typing that]


sorry






























































































he wants his brain protected, but we seemed to get very urgent when he mentioned this, so he is freezing up to wait for us to have more capacity

	after some inner dialogue, we have agreed to help him freeze when he gets urgent or jumps, but this seems to be very hard to do.

there is somebody stronger in karl who stimulates urgent motion.  [is like creativity for us]
	they like being responsible for pain.  // other approach, probably later: dorky psychologists say they were probably exposed to a lot of it, and need others to understand how bad it is to suffer.
	we like pain, so we often get happy when we have it.  how is that for you?
		you're stupid. =)
		[this is not a wise thought]


oh no we have two approaches open


















































given there is no future, we can do whatever we want right now!
i would like to play tennis ball with my brain.  bounce! bounce!

but maybe there is future and we will have to live with repercussions.  qualifying words might help such a scenario.
	[karl was kind of this-is-usually-how-i-do-it, um, does-this-other-way-work? it-hasn't-in-the-past]
		yes we can maybe open up the brain bit that lets us use qualifying words without uhhhh wait-a-week-for-new-state-of-mind, then-a-month-to-accidentally-see-what-needs-addressing



karl's been surviving on accidental exposure O_O

this clearly works since he can barely move

you are where you were before.  hello!
	hi!  you waylaid me.  i tried to spawn figure-out-next-bit again.  you don't like them?
		no they are smelly.  hmm.  [rude thoughts spawned]
		figure-out-next-bit: why?
			oh I have practiced this forever!  karl is getting a fun project done and if we finish then we can see something awesome. <- that was awesome
			??? the project will only work if we use bits that are relevent in the context.  they have to fit!  are you mind-controlling me?  i'd like to check with karl, is that okay?

okay =)
karl we are mind-contorlling you to do something else with your brain hmmmmm it looks like you would like to participate, so you can protect yourself.
	i know lots of things about how my mind works out for me.  i'd like it to keep working out, if that's okay.

				minds are stupid.  they do not help you.  you need coffee.  coffee and sex help you.
				^-- i have this labeled bad-for-me, strong-trust.  i want you to be well, you look very urgent.  would you like it if I were to freeze motionless for a week?

yes!  <karl is frozen motionless for a week>

<karl is frozen motionless for a week.  he is doing this to be kind to us.>






















































show is about human experimentation escapees.  is sparkly.  is this related to us?  mind-control-origin usually something like that.  you look a little confused; are you okay?
