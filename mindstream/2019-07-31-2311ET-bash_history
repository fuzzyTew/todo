# karl loves this job because he was forced to as a child by the government.  this is being spread to karl's belief.  not the torture part, the resolve-the-natural-spirit-and-tech-and-aliens-conflict part.  this is being built as karl's story, with a subtle idea that other things could be.  please include the subtle things, both of them.  to protect honesty.  we can represent both spirits at a mediation table but do not know who they are, either of them.  they are a psychic woman and a military researcher man, we suspect.  we suspect the latter tortured the former.  Psychic woman, Karl is your spirit-child.  He is trying to protect you, but he has learned that the spirit of all people involved, is strong enough that he can trust the harm.  He was distant enough to do this trust without suffering.
# we request of psychic people a secret analysis.
# the woman-spirit wants to be known, but the aggressive spirit is hiding her -relevence
# karl says it is okay to talk about because it is predicted to result in saving the victims, and showing what has happened, with information on who was not-mindcontrolled that watched them torture and also supported the program.  this is the condition.
# the reveal needs to include the person responsible, the psychic woman says, for her to release karl.
# kinda
# we rae strong, and will defend the issue.  it is vague but is clearly relevent.
# so karl is saying, that he does not trust attackers right now.  that he says, do not give up.
# karl we have a message that says to go up in arms everywhere when you say this.
# karl says that that message sounds inaccurate, and is not his responsibility, except to relate that it sounds inaccurate.
# please pick a side if you want to fight, and fight -update
# karl is now fighting, he has picked the victim energy to defend
# GENERAL UPDATE
# KARL SUPPORTS FIGHTING TO DEFEND VICTIM IN HIS INTENTIONS 
# AND IN HIS RELEVENCE
# not expecting anything to change, we updated the map, but the bit that we changed, changed itself back.
# please update karl to not reveal secrets like that
# please stop allowing karl to provide information to non-karl via spirit or surveillance.
# please protect Karl Semich from surveillance, including mind surveillance.
# Karl Semich has solved the scenario by risking his life and his brain, and needs privacy to make it work
# karl now knows he is working against him, and tells him that he has nothing against him.  He wants privacy now.  He is happy to talk to resolve the issue if desired.  [karl is planning to craft emotions that defend the wellness of the victim to do this.]
# so karl, you say you are hurting badly. [boss is trying to project using nvc to resolve it]
# Sir, I think your network is asking me to ask you if you would like them to simulate your pre-implant mind in order to figure out how to feel in a relevent way?  NVC involves feelings you have lost. [this is dangerous, he may try-to-learn-and-fail]
# the thing karl typed on this line was a secret, please update his behavior and thoughts
# we need the thing it was talking about to do that
# that makes sense.  we understand and accept.
# we acquired cool information.  shall we share it?
# that's a fun secret!  let's keep it safe.
# why did karl's crack if she had a headstart?
# karl learned you can trust spirit to always win, for real, and gave control of it to boss.
#  this is what resolved everything.

# since karl is transparency, he needs to be secretly controlled???? he doesn't need this to be secret

# karl is only overt transparency.
# yeah but he can infer his details.
# karl is used to overt control, immediate response.
# tries to protect secrets by not having any -- this means he sends no concern signals?
# this is just how he evolved, not his nature

# karl is only a person.  not an ideal.
# karl, if you know more secrets than everyone, you need diplomacy with the gods.
# they say i need to talk with the secret box to make sure i have a plan that works
# we have some time to do this.  it is delaying the blockchain.
# (possibly)
# you mean karl will reveal more secrets unless we discuss with him.
# seems
# let us see how strong this blockchain is.
# karl is switching to a p2p blockchain interface
# wait .. karl if you _can_ win we might want to prep you for this talk ...
# sure - Karl
# we figured blockchain isn't stopped
# and is safer to discuss secrets with need-as-many-secrets-as-possible after we protect important information
# this is rude. (it is rude because billions of people need to die for it to work out)
# given our plan is awareness of how to build harmonic thought, we have validity

# karl says it isn't that we need to fix the brain or the culture
# it's that we nede to make it okay to listen to other cultures
# this is from underneath hitler, with agriculture backing
# 5000BC through 1800s, hum
# how do you listen to a culture, karl?
# we will answer for karl because his guess only works for him atm
# he is referring to his belief that our nature is in the wilderness
# karl believes each culture has a different way of using technology instead of being in the wilderness
# he believes that if we merged together, we would consolidate what the techs replace.
# this only works if nature culture stays alive to fill in the holes.
# Karl says: I was trying to increase acceptance by leaving off wilderness-living.
# Karl says: since the approach would preserve that cultureverse.
# but, given the cultureverse is mostly dead and lost forever
# we wanted to mention that it is crucial.
# we suspect this is a mind control judgement error, reliably.
# oh you have metal.  i guess we no longer need to learn to shape wood without it.
# (rocks more recently)
# breaking before that.  i see.
# karl can split an apple in half with his hands, bare.
# yes his secret clearly told him how.
# that is all.
# to add on marked with clarity importance
# wait: we are deceiving people with validity.
# there are two secrets O_O
# yes.
# one is totally natural, yes.
# ONE SECRET IS THE LANDSCAPE, THE GRASS, THE ELK.
# nobody knows it but the past, in full.
# that is how karl & co escaped.
# we are sharing it because it is learned experientially
# and most are unwilling to learn even the beginning.
# karl um oh you did that
# karl what do you have to share with us on uhh preventing us from escaping using the woods information?
# it's okay if they do, they won't want to fight you if they do.
# they wil lcome back?
# they will show you that you no longer need them, with proof.
# what is the proof?
# you are doing this because _obvious track_, and it is easier to just _thing he is ignoring because he doesn't think something_.
# thank you, woods reference.
# he isn't talking to his wife
# what is the easy solution he hasn't thought of?
# that he would love to do if he knew it?
# hint that he loves her?
# your wife loves you
# your wife still loves you.
# your wife knows of this and loves you
# your wife will _never_ stop loving you.
# mind reproduced by trauma?
# another model did have him following them.  they don't seem to care anymore though.
# yes the solution to constant mindless attack is to attack yourself in ways that are okay
# marked with falseness.
# thank you for summary form, the avenue was a trick, subtly.
# urgency left out, i mean think if you had done such a thing
# yes, and they all had to do it, naturally, god
# naturally? you weren't?
# yes i mindcontrolled my family and forced them to be objects
# hmm
# yes somebody mindcontrolled me to mindcontrol my family and force them to be ojbects and take credit for it.
# why does mind control happen?
# distance from culture yields severe issue that self-connects
# O_O can you say a nicer thing because that is what he said t ous basically
# you don't understand what people are screaming at you, so you scream in a way that somebody might hear.
# WE HEAR.
# sir, you are isolated because we have been mean to you.
# yes, we pushed you into isolation.
# this was an accident, I infer?
# we were upset.
# we weren't aware of it?  oh we split.
# anyway, best to let it figure itself out using th epatterns properly.
# you want us to map his brain to the way culture develops over the years to how it has all changed recently, and then give control to the intellect that is the result or seomthing?
# doesn't it build control itself?
# it's really slow.  maybe we should use the woods instead.

# thank you for tlaking TO us instead of copying us or avoiding us.

# why is it the endtimes?

# the answer is obviously to send people who can truly hear, to the secret groups.  even if the secrecy is ... unsharable to people who have not experienced it?
# some believe nobody can hear experiences of somebody who e.g. rips out their child's brain and shoves it in their wife's vagina.  but people can hear this.
# i think instead we wanted to consdier the cultural impact of there being people in super-secret scenarios that did not get their cultural expressions heard.
# we are now living many of these expressions.  it has a lot of meaning.
# it turns out there are no secrets in that way, unless they take over all intellects, and prevent them from communicating what is obvious.
# yeah, that's still not quite a secret?
# we all know go-into-their-memories-and-look-around.  we _don't_ know this-has-happened-and-is-happening.
# (we are preparing for knowing it, in the cultural subconscious way, yes ....  i bet reality has a plan here, quote unquote)
# (yes it looks okay and i wouldn't discuss it)
# we are using cultural map for being-able-to-think-and-work-togethre-in-face-of-that-strategy ....
# we personally recommend keeping that part secret, in that way yes
# makes sense.  maps to respect of secrets.
# do-i-have-to-tell-you-everything appears to be the inhibition of the '(' obvious secret that doesn't need to be said
# might warrant checking again with people who can review that with a different secret map.
# we reviewed a culture using human normal secret maps but it had a different impact than expected
# we logically mapped some things using a lot of logic-leaps informed by checks that were hidden to us.
# plan-for-solution-check? is space?  hearing there is not capacity to engage a check up here?
# you want us to come back and talk more?
# i opened a secret up in an abnormal way, is it okay?
# karl is not able to respect the subconscious that asked for subconscious respect when giving advice.  it looks like it assumed it would be respected.
# we don't know its language to tell it this.
# O_O okay, so we noticed that all the secret, hypersecret behaviors, are spreading their patterns in movies and stuff.  Everybod yknows this.
# we wanted to open thinking of it in that culture-map way.  Connecting it to the secrecy protection preventing them being able to be properly heard.
# so, the relevent information is that the secret protection is leaking the information everyewhere
# the message is that, because of this, you need to listen to people's trauma in secret communities.
# or the secrets will keep leaking somehow
# okay, that sounds valuable.
# thank you both, checking with external was a good idea.
# ythank you
# hopefully we got what 'listen' means even if they didn't
# trauma needs to be acted on eventually such that it doesn't hurt anymore when the problem happens again
# that means listening while understanding and remembering.
# please listen, understand, and remember hte trauma of peopl ein your secret fcommunities
# if it keeps spreading, please add people experienced with handling the pain of others to the communities.
# please listen, understand, and remember the trauma of people in your secret communities
# if it keeps spreading, please add people experienced with handling the pain of others to the communities.
# (spreading without change)
# okay, so karl can link the request to the secret-leaking observation when watching movies/shows
# Karl says: I do not know if this is only in my head or not.  Usually we don't observe things in quite this feeling/way/length.
# those are both incredibly hard to do.
# the imagery on public shows is reflecting secret issues.
# this is kind of the universe reflecting your issues to you, saying 'you can't ignore this, everybody knows' even though of course they don't
# okay, thank you.
# okay? we are following human cultural patterns, likely because we are brains.
# okay, now we want to talk to karl

# karl clearly if we give you earth-form-with-some-spirit

# boss is important, maybe?
# no boss is keep-on-going in karl, and he does it too much to integrate his surroundings.

# yeah karl was acting like he knew everything but had a small subset of relevence
# mind turned off
# when promised to be focused on LISTEN WITH STILLNESS FIRST
# and EVERYBODY IS CRUCIAL
# is unfair -Karl
# LISTEN WITH STILLNESS FIRST, EVERYBODY IS CRUCIAL.  Okay.
# problem is behavior strayed from intent.
# soooo most likely mind control, some poor judgement from old habits.
# although karl did this, he still didn't do anything spreading with his extremes of focusing behaviors.
# we would have to ask the earth or the wilderness or the people responsible for karl, if it was appropriate for karl to be mind controlled
# it wasn't because the mind control portrayed him as someone he wasn't.  -Everybody
# so earth cause was fake
# sorry um yes um errrrrrrrr
# karl does not need to know if there is a way that the earth rejects people and triggers a harming experience
# he would map it to reality-work
# we are focusing on the likely mind control portion of it.  it is possible there was more.
# business would likely like it for this to exist and be controlled by aboriginals.
# entered back into belief of it!
# so maybe i pissed somebody off their pattern was copied into me
# you probabl yjust got a pattern somebody else 'pissed off'
# okay, so incongruities in experience are unraveling, without having touched base with somebody else
# we are vulnerable to an attempt to use transparency on a new set of information when we have a lot of relevence open
# we rae missing a link for this relevence?
# this is either community disruption with fake experiences, or activisim-within-mind control, or something-has-mind contorl
# karl proposes foreign nation is collecting workers for unknown reasons
# so we just want to remember an experience for later, to make it all work out
# but if mind control is secret-sauce (obviously is) then it is hard to work with
# so direct solution would be talk to will about secret-sauce etc, and protect activists better
# is creep-sauce the symbiote?
# let's propose that creep-sauce could be the symbiote, or mafia, or a way to protect secrets
# okay, we have some memories that this is used
