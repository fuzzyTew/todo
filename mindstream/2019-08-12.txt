some of this shit is [guessed] and [private]
connection appears rude


But!

We could consider that somebody/people are being severely tortured at the hands of human experimentation,
have developed this to the point of being [horrifically] normal for them,
and are now saving the world from a place of constant traumatic pain.

		some people have their hearts pulled by people being in great pain
		these people can be made use of, if they consent, by those who have been through great pain

[if you come to my home starving with your arm half-ripped-off, I will help you.  yes.]
	- everybody in most countries

		if this does not happen, it is likely because of mind control or something similar.
okay, or poor communication.
so, let's write issues here, to explain?

	[they think i am a monster]  [what do they say?] [you mind controlled my child]
	_you_ are also someone's mind controlled child. <=======

		noise in connection is how this appears on my end

	[i can't say i am a victim because of my programming]
	^--- i am actually a little confused here myself, due to this applying to me too
	
		Robert says, roughly you can just say the sentence.
	so, maybe
	"I've memorized this sentence": "I can't say I am a victim because of my programming."

		we need to add how-to-help because things are shitty

	then we run into the issue that
	- many don't feel free to help against world superpowers
	and
	- nobody knows how to help if they do feel free

	"I just want somebody to talk to about this who can believe what I say, and help me keep talking =("
		"the things i have to express are unbelievably traumatic"

			i'm not free to pursue physical solutions atm myself; get too confused, others don't believe it fully
			issue: there's an ongoing story of people who behave this way being crazy and needing meds

	to-karl: kate will believe you
