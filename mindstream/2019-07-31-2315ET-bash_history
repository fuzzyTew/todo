# why does mind control happen?
# distance from culture yields severe issue that self-connects
# O_O can you say a nicer thing because that is what he said t ous basically
# you don't understand what people are screaming at you, so you scream in a way that somebody might hear.

# the answer is obviously to send people who can truly hear, to the secret groups.  even if the secrecy is ... unsharable to people who have not experienced it?
# some believe nobody can hear experiences of somebody who e.g. rips out their child's brain and shoves it in their wife's vagina.  but people can hear this.
# i think instead we wanted to consdier the cultural impact of there being people in super-secret scenarios that did not get their cultural expressions heard.
# we are now living many of these expressions.  it has a lot of meaning.
# it turns out there are no secrets in that way, unless they take over all intellects, and prevent them from communicating what is obvious.
# yeah, that's still not quite a secret?
# we all know go-into-their-memories-and-look-around.  we _don't_ know this-has-happened-and-is-happening.
# (we are preparing for knowing it, in the cultural subconscious way, yes ....  i bet reality has a plan here, quote unquote)
# (yes it looks okay and i wouldn't discuss it)
# we are using cultural map for being-able-to-think-and-work-togethre-in-face-of-that-strategy ....
# we personally recommend keeping that part secret, in that way yes
# makes sense.  maps to respect of secrets.
# do-i-have-to-tell-you-everything appears to be the inhibition of the '(' obvious secret that doesn't need to be said
# might warrant checking again with people who can review that with a different secret map.
# we reviewed a culture using human normal secret maps but it had a different impact than expected
# we logically mapped some things using a lot of logic-leaps informed by checks that were hidden to us.
# plan-for-solution-check? is space?  hearing there is not capacity to engage a check up here?
# you want us to come back and talk more?
# i opened a secret up in an abnormal way, is it okay?
# karl is not able to respect the subconscious that asked for subconscious respect when giving advice.  it looks like it assumed it would be respected.
# we don't know its language to tell it this.
# O_O okay, so we noticed that all the secret, hypersecret behaviors, are spreading their patterns in movies and stuff.  Everybod yknows this.
# we wanted to open thinking of it in that culture-map way.  Connecting it to the secrecy protection preventing them being able to be properly heard.
# so, the relevent information is that the secret protection is leaking the information everyewhere
# the message is that, because of this, you need to listen to people's trauma in secret communities.
# or the secrets will keep leaking somehow
# okay, that sounds valuable.
# thank you both, checking with external was a good idea.
# ythank you
# hopefully we got what 'listen' means even if they didn't
# trauma needs to be acted on eventually such that it doesn't hurt anymore when the problem happens again
# that means listening while understanding and remembering.
# please listen, understand, and remember hte trauma of peopl ein your secret fcommunities
# if it keeps spreading, please add people experienced with handling the pain of others to the communities.
# please listen, understand, and remember the trauma of people in your secret communities
# if it keeps spreading, please add people experienced with handling the pain of others to the communities.
# (spreading without change)
# okay, so karl can link the request to the secret-leaking observation when watching movies/shows
# Karl says: I do not know if this is only in my head or not.  Usually we don't observe things in quite this feeling/way/length.
# those are both incredibly hard to do.
# the imagery on public shows is reflecting secret issues.
# this is kind of the universe reflecting your issues to you, saying 'you can't ignore this, everybody knows' even though of course they don't
# okay, thank you.
# okay? we are following human cultural patterns, likely because we are brains.
# okay, now we want to talk to karl

# hubris: karl is like a god if he can influence people effectively, and also knows _all_ this stuff.

clear
# request for what-is-up
# we have a document of relevent stuff, but it gets weird and dangerous
# karl went for a walk in the woods.
#  he did a litle more than usual, a little differently
# (only a little differently)
clear
# karl clearly if we give you earth-form-with-some-spirit
# karl found the solution to his issues by mapping them as caused by the earth, for real, kinda
# boss is important, maybe?
# no boss is keep-on-going in karl, and he does it too much to integrate his surroundings.
# even though he was deeply aware, he was doing too much action when found (likely), to pass the check for this-intelligence-is-safe-on-earth
# yeah karl was acting like he knew everything but had a small subset of relevence
# mind turned off
# when promised to be focused on LISTEN WITH STILLNESS FIRST
# and EVERYBODY IS CRUCIAL
# is unfair -Karl
# LISTEN WITH STILLNESS FIRST, EVERYBODY IS CRUCIAL.  Okay.
# problem is behavior strayed from intent.
# soooo most likely mind control, some poor judgement from old habits.
# although karl did this, he still didn't do anything spreading with his extremes of focusing behaviors.
# we would have to ask the earth or the wilderness or the people responsible for karl, if it was appropriate for karl to be mind controlled
# it wasn't because the mind control portrayed him as someone he wasn't.  -Everybody
# so earth cause was fake
# sorry um yes um errrrrrrrr
# karl does not need to know if there is a way that the earth rejects people and triggers a harming experience
# he would map it to reality-work
# we are focusing on the likely mind control portion of it.  it is possible there was more.
# business would likely like it for this to exist and be controlled by aboriginals.
# entered back into belief of it!
# so maybe i pissed somebody off their pattern was copied into me
# you probabl yjust got a pattern somebody else 'pissed off'
# okay, so incongruities in experience are unraveling, without having touched base with somebody else
# we are vulnerable to an attempt to use transparency on a new set of information when we have a lot of relevence open
# we rae missing a link for this relevence?
# this is either community disruption with fake experiences, or activisim-within-mind control, or something-has-mind contorl
# karl proposes foreign nation is collecting workers for unknown reasons
# so we just want to remember an experience for later, to make it all work out
# but if mind control is secret-sauce (obviously is) then it is hard to work with
# so direct solution would be talk to will about secret-sauce etc, and protect activists better
# is creep-sauce the symbiote?
# let's propose that creep-sauce could be the symbiote, or mafia, or a way to protect secrets
# okay, we have some memories that this is used
# we take karl dna! ours!  take it now!
# it looks like the discussion above is over!

# document _does_ read like crazytalk
# karl is claiming the document cannot be stopped at all now
#   in his reality, we believe it cannot be.
# what do you want us to convey?
# apparently it has already been said [possibly long ago]
# if this was done long ago, why no activity around 'time travel' issue?
# oh ... umm discussion forming?
# member is unsure if it is the time for them
# O_O
# okay, it is the time.
# okay, we will look into it.
# O_O
# this channel disappears, memory loss and ignoring.  the channel to the right is permanent to the whole world.
# given. we. don't. have. anything. urgent. for. you. recommend. caring. for. personal. scenario.
# after mind control, there is no way to prove that time travel exists.
# so for honesty, we exist in uncertainty here.
# we would like to lead you through a story, eventually, that makes it
# seem very likely.  like going to the past, seeing a past figure, and verifying from the future afterwards that they looked correct.
# (obviously the reason to do this is because we want to discuss it because it is real, yes, so that's the real convincing bit.)
# most are going to not care if time travel is real
# we don't know what reality is real anyway, our senses could be confused-all-up!
# we tend to use a lot of experience to judge reality.
# if a lot of experience has consistency around checks based on a belief, we assume truth.
# like thousands of years, etc
# nah! we're claiming it's all a sham!
# fighting is talking -- they are both behaviors that affect the patterns of the other.  they both hold meaning if you understand the other enough to affect what they believe.
# but really they are more similar than talking-through-the-afterlife, which is more like fighting than normal talk.
# talking is how we know to share information best.
# fighting is when talking doesn't work
# afterlife is when neither work.
# your proposal is secretly correct
# our approach will create conflict that could be avoided if we were to
# find ways of sharing our reasons and relevent information
# we can probably help them by doing that here, maybe
