considering enforcing a delay on computer.  could also switch to white/green XO laptop, which is slower to use.

make-money <- works, karl.  but don't do it yourself.  get FUNDRAISING so you get outreach too.  need organizing around fundraising?

	freelance-sw-work
do-not-make-crypto-bot might be arbitrary.  there's stopping for everything.
live-without-money-or-dexterity-or-memory  (we could let go completely, but there is relevence to experiences unaddressed)
we do not want you broke.  where does your money come from?  [it is a balance between the unexpected expenses and occasional windfalls, roughly]
	we know sae connector now.  maybe that is enough without buying it.  sounds reasonable.
	let's consolidate with a task list.
could we collaborate on how much money to have?  boss-wants-control-of-money-supply. dictatorship communism.
karl-believes-put-money-together-for-shared-projects.  boss, would you manage karl's money?  as the supply?
	why do you want karl to fundraise O_O  karl roleplays: probably so that i work with others rather than self-focusing, and contribute in non-monetary ways

we are happy found SAE connector and want the relevence
	12v power in cave
	powerpole conncteors are expensive and slow to build
	desire to charge green laptop off of a vehicle.

get sae-powerpole adapter
