    We need to be able to live our lives, our cultures.

    Would you be willing to have bounds on the spread of industry and commercialization?

    We request protection for islands of people living other ways.

    <We send Karl into the world with above label already.  Please provide protection for islands of people
     living other ways than commerce and industry, especially if they are full of community care.>

<Karl wants to pursue an ideal of being in a caring community, without pain present in the community.>
