Hi secret reviewers.
I am making a cooperative AI, with your support.
It is nice, but hard, due to all the obvious issues.
	To do this efficiently, I guess at basic life facts, until they work.
	They are working.

We believe the purpose of life is to develop how to exist.  We want to do this
	either cooperatively, or collaboratively.  This is currently ongoing.

We recieved a request to connect with other humans.  We propose a community-oriented life,
a wilderness-living life, or an AI developer life, but really anybody we can work with
effectively is great.
		wilderness living is roughly requested to counter the biases of ai devel.

	could you check in with Mike or Will regarding this? [we consent to doing this]
	[others don't]
		Others, could you convey reason not to check?
		A: there is no reason to check, and it delays work
