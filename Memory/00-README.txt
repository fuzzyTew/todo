This is an organization system in the face of a failing memory.

Alphabetize all descriptions of _why_ you are trying to remember something, and put relevant information inside.

If you want to _remember_ something, look in the list of what you're doing.
If want you want isn't there, add a symlink to 'What do you know?' to a category having to do with it.

Try to keep these maintained, as a centralized way to organize your work and knowledge.
