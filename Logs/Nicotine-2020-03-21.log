	trying to take nicotine agian.  late.  very lucky to be trying again.  very very very lucky.
		it doesn't look the storj gateway is very permanent or easy for others to access
		bitcoin-testnet seems a little more reliable, but also gets rebooted occasionally =/

	Videologging has stopped.  Once phone is out of battery, the other out of storage space.
	To resume, could figure out what script is doing slowly to fix things, and do it manually faster.
		kind of want to take a break without food or nicotine
		please fix videologging

		Propose: log substances with density of ingredients, give labels to substances
			log mass of sugar & mass of nicotine lozense
	- [ ] store videologs and automate
