progress?

script would work if it retriggered itself.  it doesn't at this time.
could add tobacco.  I'm breaking sugar.
I have many urges throughout the day.  I could try to mvf them with toothbrushing and this script.  takes a ton of willpower.
	likely effective if I can do that willpower
		dunno how i'll sustain belief that it will work


strategies:
	- [ ] real tobacco
	- [ ] sugar
	- [ ] other urges
	- [ ] WILLPOWER and BELIEF
	- [ ] UNBLOCK alarm AFTER brushing, if possible
