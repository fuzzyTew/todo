task priority
- aux script reorder toothbrush task
	-> next to routine, instead of running 'routine brushing.routine'
	I'll run some other script
	that provides quickly for assessing whether or not I have accomplished a routine
	and orders them to manage that.
		1st order of business: begin doing this such that I can continue
		2nd: discern how to order.  perhaps have a strategy that can be changed

- refine list
- fix rating

status for memory:

- routine stores in csvs
- routine reads from .routine file, very simple space-separated format! easy for c++ iostream
- use system(3) to work with shell, move concepts, use old in shell
- .C file make script: STRONG SRONG SCRIPT SCRIPT WHAT SCRIPT
- SCRIPT IN .C STRONG STRONG SCRIPT STRONG CSV SCRIPT ORDER LIST PARSE SCRIPT SRONG
	NEE SCRIPT  ASSES ACCOMPLISH ROUTINE
	MANY ROUtiNE ITEMS
	CSVS ROUTINES above
move notes C file
problem: hard switch, clicking is slow for me.  Store in repo
	ORDER REORDER
	LOOK HISTORY JUDGE
	JUDGE HISTORY
	how good am I at this task compared to others?
	later: order strategy
	sure small clas QUICK DUDE QUICK
	always fail class quick class?
	just make class 1 func
	name, nothing else
	STORE LOCAL MEMBERS !!! yes yes
	WHAT DO? in class !

solved shell use system move c++

csv needed? write shell script do parsing!  use exec in c++ to handle.  moves toward c++ !
		okay .C file
		exec shell script? can't be too hard

in dev-whonix solved
