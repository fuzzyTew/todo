## TASKS INSIDE
- Routine:
	- Phone routines
	- Check calendar
  - Check 12v battery voltage
  - Change batteries on openbci
- [ ] index some outdoor maintenance tasks
- [ ] fill projects below based on goals farther below; do the tasks

## BRING INSIDE

## DO OUTSIDE
- [ ] 6/24: UPDATE OVH
- Routine:
	if needed, bring food in
	swap batteries
	if needed, bring drinking water
	if needed, bring washing water in
	if needed, empty greywater
	change toilets
	if needed, empty trash and recycling

	increase the organization of 1 box or item
		-> try labeling a box based on what's inside it
	water house plants
	sync with github for katie
	download email
  	move laundry along
	bring in 1 welding item at least, until enough for steel box?
	do an extra sitz bath & fissure treatment with warm water
	check snailmail (both porch and hanging)
	post a bounty towards distributed dat logstreams

- [ ] order more plastic powerpole housings
- [ ] Out of the house
	- [ ] get prescription fluoride gel from serios (could bring old)
	      katie is on this but she's also on the insurance address call
	- [ ] visit collective copies and check if they got the scanner going, get the model number of their scanner?
		-> closes at 5
- [ ] finish purchasing box truck
	- [ ] get mechanic to check it out
		- [X] record here the date expected to be done, and check on that date
			- [X] they say they'll know today or tomorrow
				(Fri 2018-06-08 or Sat 2018-06-09)
		- [X] Price is >$3400 .  Get money in account.
		   -> on its way but balance is tight
		- [ ] Estimated completion is by Thu 2018-06-21 but he said
		      he hadn't checked every single state inspection
		      requirement.  Update status here.
	- [ ] look into getting a rearview cam at Long Radio
		-> I think Crankshaft is a better solution.
		   It's an open source auto head unit using a raspberry pi.
		   there are other ones too
		-> unfortunataly there's no turn-key solution for replacing
		   the radio completely with a pi.  people are instead
		   plugging the pi into the audio in of the radio.
		   an amplifier board is needed such as PAM8610
		   for which wiring and soldering are needed
		-> aftermarket wiring harness color coding is online
		-> plan is to use single-board computers using my cam
		   network system.
	- [ ] get the owner's manual, possibly at Nutmeg International
	                                         in west springfield
- [ ] if step available, pursue learn to emit, detect, block, and drown all frequencies of all media at all distances
	- [ ] 1 MHz audio
		-> Look up freq range of ultrasound devices
			-> acoustic microscopy goes up into multi-GHz
			   but air has very poor impedance with solids for this
		-> see acoustic impedance in wikipedia, acoustic attenuation
		-> picosecond ultrasonics; generated by laser pulses to heat a film; laser is also bounced off of film to detect reflection
		-> 1 MHz has high penetration and is lower than used for
		   ultrasonic microscopy
		-> 40 khz is used for ultrasound cleaning.
		-> 1.7 - 2.4 mhz is used for making mist
		-> 1mhz - 3 mhz facial cleaning
		-> I'm going to need things on impedance matching,
		   signal generation, amplification.  This is similar
		   to radio.
		- [ ] start a document enumerating frequency bands
		- [ ] emit
			-> I've ordred transducers for .2 Mhz and 1.7 MHz
			-> there's a 5 MHz one but it's super expensive
			-> 2.4 MHz is also used for misting, have not
			   ordered.
			-> Need information on impedance matching,
			   signal generation & detection at electrical
			   level first, to run tests
		- [ ] detect
		- [ ] block
		- [ ] drown
- [ ] On 2018-07-19, check soapy_power status of my existing pr
	-> no reply yet after 5 days
	url is https://github.com/xmiko/soapy_power/pull/11
	-> added comment 2018-04-08
	-> added comment 2018-04-14 stating i would check back in a month
	-> added comment 2018-06-19 expressing possibility of forking or
	   choosing a different project

- [X] check shipping status on noise generators
	-> Fri Jun 22 !
	-> one Jul 7
- [X] order replacement fuse for low-gauge wires on inverter.  Blew a 50A

	but no wire thicker than 10 gauge in the tent.
- [X] order short male-male SMA adapter; like the wires I ordered but compact
- [X] get a mortar and pestle
	- [X] get medical dot card

		      what I need from others
- [X] process items in out and waiting boxes and add an entry for each one
- [X] buy sonicare usb charging base
	the replacement diamondclean base I got inductively charges.
	It's possible it could be good to get a whole brush because the head
	  mating shapes differ.
- [X] buy UHF Male (SO-239?) Connector for discone antenna
