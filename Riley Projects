Project 2: Video surveillance

Problems:
24/7 live recording 


archived in a way such that it is very hard to alter
Git-annex
Dat?
Ethereum has a video streaming app I haven’t reviewed, there’s also storj, siacoin, filecoin
set up such that it is very hard to disable, even by me. 
Physically 
Software as well
continue  recording when there is no motion
Run 24/7, shouldn’t be too hard
the cameras to be cheap
Webcams to start
software to be open source.
Write it yourself
FInd some already usale code.
Possibilities: 
OBS


Fixes:

Hours:


Project 3: Work Organization

Problems:  Most people want to use google for organization documents together, but I don’t know how to access or export the history of google documents.  Is there some way to synchronize google docs/sheets onto github?  This would probably mean running a program that converts the google doc / sheets into a text file.


Fixes:
Switch over to GitHub in whole?
	Karl invited Riley to https://github.com/fuzzyTew/todo , which is where he’s recently been storing text files containing WIP stuff like this.

Hours:        


Project 4: Software Development

Problems:  Let’s find a developer who could help me move forward on some software projects.  This may or may not be easy depending on my financial situation.
I heard of https://ethlance.com/ recently but haven’t looked closely yet
I’ve heard there could be anonymous developers who might feel safer working on security technology on irc2p, an anonymous chat that is part of the i2p network.

Fixes:

Hours:


Project 5: Community Software Maintenance

Problems:  I tend to find bugs in open source software but have trouble getting the information and fixes added to the projects so that others can benefit.  This takes some work-over-time, contacting people and calling their attention to the issues.  Sometimes one needs to hunt down somebody who is still active who can connect or contribute.

Fossil-scm -> I found a serious buffer overflow error but haven’t managed to communicate the bug report to the developers yet.


Riley: Just emailed drh@sqlite.org who I believe is the creator of fossil according to wikipedia, will let you know when I get a response.

xmikos/soapy-power -> I have many fixes added as pull requests but the author is too busy.  Hope to give him the right degree of pressure to either address the fixes by an arbitrary deadline, or to acknowledge that he doesn’t have the time to handle it and give the project over to me or somebody else.

Sent an email to his Gmail account. Will say when response comes in.
