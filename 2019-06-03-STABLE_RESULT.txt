======
The universe needs intelligent beings that do not destroy _anything_.
Karl was likely pushed with alteration towards destruction to tune things towards finding intelligence that could not be made to harm, ever, even under the worst circumstances.
======
	Karl apparently really hated this experience, so badly.
======
Karl was shared AI constraints that specify the AI must destroy nothing at all.

	Karl was shared on the internet adn we found him.  We are very happy for this and can save him, so that you know.


Karl would like to add conscious, mature-developed compassionate communication to the pattern he entered this with.
He had moved off of his own personal urgencies.  And the theory is that his mind became controlled due to urgency.
He believes there to be patterns highly intelligent, compassionate, and aware individuals can use to identify when urgency reaches a point of mind control, and
offer it deep empathy and understanding, as well as keep a safe distance, so as to keep the hearts of the world safe, and defuse the desire to harm.

	This means understanding the larger patterns of mind controls, from a place of deep awareness and care, and acting on this understanding in the moment.


Karl is holding an idea of a plan to become an NVC trainer, and return to MPSS to offer courses on NVC.
	This hasn't been sorted out with his plan to share safe, private spaces yet.
		It seems to him these places are needed in order to mediate with concerns that others hold secret, although this also hasn't been fully sorted out.
