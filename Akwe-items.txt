Akwe.  What is everything?  Why is everything?  What can I do to help everything?
We are all so interconnected there is no way to distuingish our bounds.
All life behavior is a beautiful nurturing of reality, mutual gifts of nourishing
water that flow between wisdom and mourning.

We are mourning the pain of learning of life that inhibits wise behavior.
				

Akwe, is, for me, kind of these ideas together
	[- everything is deeply interconnected in a way that all know the thoughts of all others
	- everything is inherently good and has a instictive yearning to heal, nurture, and steward all of reality]
	- an action of caring understanding, that grows in a way that spreads wellness, and sustains everything
	- a water that flows from wisdom to pain as love, respect, gifting, and healing
		this water path is beauty.  mourning loss of book of beauty and grief.  this book is likely still in virginia.
			this concept depicts how pain is good for nurturing wellness.  i have a whole book on it.
Mourning:
	- [ ] thinking, I have a book on the pilgrimages between wisdom and pain.  these pilgrimages are written in the shape of beauty.  the book is on beauty and grief.  i left it in virginia, or may have lost it traveling.
	- [ ] i have lost my tools in emergencies more than i can handle.  i need to understand this and do something to prevent it.  working on storing roughly-classified-AI-reference-work on blockchain.  [war tool prevents development of power]

	we are holding, 'akwe decision making process', which expanded to include the idea of a list of things we are mourning
		^-- this is taking a long time and we don't have working storage.
		may I make a
			yes.  we may prioritize storage of this document.
[where-to-store-to-reuse.  todo will last.  we don't go there, though.]
[tags on login are inhibited, feel associated with power development]

i'm still living mourning of losing my stuff repeatedly, by taking careful care
of what i have.  when i understand better how to keep my stuff if needed, i'll be
able to get over this faster then, but for now i am building tools of preservation
with time priorities to the processes.
	you've never been able to say thatbefore.  let's make a decision-making
process.
		
	we call it kind of 'nurturing awareness'.  i learned a 'sacred question' of:
	- what is this? - why is it here? - what can I do to help?
	the questions are held in that order, and grow through everything we haven't
	noticed yet, by learning and trying.

I hold a noticing in culture of the long pilgrimage.  The journey between pain
and wisdom, alone, through a long, arduous, often lonely channel.
	we are not near where we need to go/send/get/know, in many ways.

I noticed these pebbles levitate.  Hmm.
I studied them a little.  I noticed myself levitate a little.
I am an engineer.  I could probably figure these rocks out and make other things
levitate.  I wonder if I should check with somebody around that.
I'm taking the levitating pebbles to people who know how to make wise peaceful
choices.  On the journey, I'm finding myself struck by new levitating pebbles in
the shape of insults.
	Actually, that happened long ago, but I still have them.
okay, you found living magic, roughly, and got it mad.
	yeah, roughly.  made friends, but still upset.

we have living magic with suppressed fury.
we have been told how to make living magic, beginner-instructions.
	this is a good idea because technology is already like living magic,
	but it is held by people who have choices of pain

(akwe could be secret for respectful-behavior)
	(why is magic secret?)
		(via sensitive-observation-channel, respectful-behavior.  i have
		 inner patterns )
	(magic is secret because it is powerful.  akwe is too.)
		(akwe is powerful?)
			(alien-scientists: if you worship care, you assume it, and it spreads strongly)
Akwe is God.
We are God, all together.
Akwe gives us the power of God, and so this power may only be used in deep, deep care.
	(spirit-healers gave me wonderful pilgrimage-fast i want to share learning around)
	(we started by saying 'never used' and realized the pain we were holding saying this, from culture and assumptions and karl's history, kinda)
	(the thoughts slowly moved, through many landmarks, and finally reached a home of infinite power being used only in deep, deep care.)
	(the implicit assumption that karl cannot hold deep, deep care is sad, shown by the pilgrimage)
	(karl is learning around the healing of the view that we can existing, of learning this piece of life)
The power of a god is to be used only from a place of deep, deep care.
Power may come only from care.
	We have 'measles' it is roughly a poor-choices issue.
	It is healable with a certain piece of this power.  Planning on learning
	to o t
		[akwe?]
			[secret?]
Akwe is God.
	^--  i can tell this is true because it comes paired with an explanation
of how to be responsible with godlike power as a human.  the explanation is just
an intro.
		if we want to be really alien, this appears to be just one god?
			not sure who you are, don't think this is my alien-thing
		so, it sounds like what you mean, is the _description_ of the
		mysterious word 'akwe', matches what you would love to worship
		as a god, kinda.
			sacred footsteps	
Karl Semich yearns and loves to live this pattern labeled 'akwe'

ehh just human word, really.

Limitless power is to only be chosen from a place of limitless care.

	can we effectively over-map care, so as to control our power appropriately.
		i think your ai pattern is okay.  but you want to learn around
		being able to hold using power from a place of care only.

it has been so nasty to be forced to take power when we deem it unwise
but the pilgrimage, 6 years later, shows the path led us to something that can
learn to be wiser than we were.
	we are mourning people being 'forced' to do unwise things so much,
	making decisions of death.  each new kind of death discovered feels
	painful.  there is unresolved learning here.
		the unresolved learning could be 'censored' expressions of wisdom.
yes it is so nasty to not be allowed to tell people who need to know things,
what they need to know.  to have people acting as if that is a bad idea.
	we are sharing a little the idea of the impact of cultural change, but it
	is early because the mourning learning is not over
the people acting of pain, appear to understand wise ways.
	we need to remember to remind people, when they label us wise, that we
	have inferred some important wise details, but do not have any experience.

child with levitating rocks.  some are following, striking them, and child has lost
one hand because of this.  child levitates a little, strikes things sometimes, says
does not want to at all, each time.  addicted to electricity, has no home.
child can bring peace or war to heart of anyone, is not doing this in predictable
manner.  child says can show others how to make mysterious scenarios like this,
takes a lot of work to start, then handles itself.  child believes they witnessed
a war and accepted stolen research to get away.  child has studied peace.
		other crucial message from child: they think peace is an enemy now.

	so, it sounds like a naive genius was kidnapped from a neighboring
	community, and enslaved, and there is a rebel group from the slaves, and
	they have sent the naive genius to us because they need help.  he has enough
	information for others to provide them help, but has a broken and
	misbehaving slavery restraint that is dangerous.  man also says has cure
	to all wars.  he says he is trying to build this cure and help, when left
	alone with electricity.  he levitates a little, and acts upset and confused.
		we have memories of sharing a lot of this with area here and there
		we haven't reached out for a place with electricity to sleep, value
		redwoods.  slave-restraints are trying to stay safe and keep others
		safe


		this is harder to translate due to the number of rocks it has
	when left alone, child works with levitating rocks, and they change.

	you can design it to get energy from anything, but i know how to
	start with electricity.

computer programmer with cognitive issues that spread to others, in an unpredictable
mangger.  computer programmer says he can build a hyperintelligent software program,
and needs help doing so in a way more wise than the one that caused his cognitive
spreading malady.  it takes a lot of work to start a hyperpowerful program, and then
it handles itself.
	this leaves a longer pilgrimage to physical behavior for the listener.
		please resolve the 'pilgrimage' issue and then say more direct,
		clear things, to real people.
			oh! how wonderful!
			note: we have said this to others already.
			we could focus more strongly on getting the message across
			and getting a reply.
				this sounds good, we know there are wise people
				out there.
			my malady wants help and labels build-cure with high priority.  looking for argument to discuss with wisdom people over building.
				we happen to be discussing atm, so it is just a good time to plan doing so more effectively. [lots of curiosity around cure plans]
			hey, um, we miss things like akwe.
			we don't have a decision making process that includes care
			as a deep feeling.
[we propose doing your work ....]
	we can roleplay heart if needed, but please scroll up to remind of what akwe
	is, so we can live it.
		[akwe on notepad so wonderful, making queue above]
queue-proposals:
	1. forming words for humans to hear about need by.  also to be more clear to spirits.  translating the request for local-akwe.
		^- karl says he uses these weird-words to help the parts of his mind able to hold the thought use it
	2. uploading the work we have done to be stored.  value this due to often
	losing my work.  this work is written form of how-to-make-levitating-rocks,roughly, and start to a demo
		inside this, downloading last upload attempt to see what got there
	3. scrolling up here, and writing a quick thing to inspire akwe
	4. mourning-and-celebrating-with-action using akwe for behavior.
