So many of you have been through so much
	So many of you have been through _so_ much
Please, please, nurture your lives.

Me, I've been through -so- much,
	Please nurture my life.

People have been through so much,
	Please nurture the world
		Please nurture the world.

We have a little freedom in our systems if we have them,
	In our lives if we don't,
		To move a little towards things getting so, so much better
				So, so much better.

We have a little freedom in our systems,
	To move a litle towards,
		Things getting so, so much better
			So, so much better.
