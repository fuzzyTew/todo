When things aren't right:

    - try repeating to self: "I'm terrified of hurting myself from being terrified."
    - stay present and focus on keeping things more okay, even if this takes a very very long time
    - focus on an unrelated spot, on body or in environment, with a little feedback and changing.  come back to this focus in a slightly new way.
    - tell things that cause harm that it is _not_ time to cause harm
    - learn around when things go a little worse.  see if there are small ways to reduce this.
    - stay "middle" (not hyperfocused or extreme or spending a lot of time in an unwise thought).  pay attention when not "middle", and return to "middle", and check in. tick tock.
