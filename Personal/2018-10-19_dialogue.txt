i was trying to think of a plot for a cool movie

The brain is made of modules.  Each one << but i got stopped here

I started watching a stylish movie, and thought "all these brain-tech movies just barely touch the surface"
and started thinking of attributes that would make a really cool brain tech movie.

I started including attributes that seemed important, like using precise timing to teach a piece of the
brain to transmit information towards an 'in' to a portion of it, and describing how that could reach
into different bits of different pieces of the brain, and would use a language designed by the interractions
with it, kinda.  but i tried to say it more stylish.

okay tell me more about the 'language'

well i was thinking there'd only be so many physical neurons transmitting information to whatever the
connection the piece of the brain was, so you'd have to train the bit that connection had been initially
crafted with, to speak in som ekind of code, in order to transmit more different things than there were
numbers of neurons touching it
	<< like youd look for a bit of the brain that can interconnect the bits flexibly, and time the stimulations in such a way it began responding, developing more and more interconnection with it, and getting information to flow to and from other modules
	<< the imagination included differnt kinds of people, like some just using the tech crudely, some getting deep into the details of how to get really skillful and tiny little patterns in far reaches of things, and such
	<< thought a super skillful person could be main character

like that thing that neurons speak in ummm pulse timing or something? rate coding. that.

yeah but developed specifically to hold new kinds of information, built by timing

timing -- plasticity yes.  so you'd 
	<< i was thinking a way to get plasticity to happen would be to create stimulations in sync with other stimulations.  'neurons that fire together wire together' i saw in an intro-to-neuroscience video.  it also mentioned there being a specific delay that produced highest plasticity.  these details often feel super terrifying, but i see other terrifying things in movies, and i thought a movie that just named them all in detail would really have high suspension of disbelief and be much more ngaging

so you were talking about the physical processos of our network

just ilke the movies do but with more 'stuff' in it to make it more interesting

that's incredibly cool

oh thank you!

[i have to kill you now but of course iw on't]

no i mean the rate coding thing

what's really cool is that he can guess stuff that would make this work without us telling him anything
that's incredibly cool
you're saying his guesses are right?
errr one of them was as far as i understand.

he thinks that we can use multiple moeds of communication; e.g. if it was an implant, that you could also do
it just with a microphone and timed advertisements or something.  (now that's incredibly cool)

>> yeah we were thinking ti would be different in different countries: some aboveground, some using drugs, different things
	>> but probably some people would know about the different forms and some wouldn'lt
		>> it sounds so cool
	>> the main character could discover this, like in the matrix a little
		>> maybe
	>> they'd probably get involved in crime, and start working these more intense things
		>> they developed the skill aboveground, but got caught up underground somehow maybe

okay now he vomits but we don't have it be bad and it's just imaginary vomit

he was going to come up with more stuff like those 2 things but we made it hrder

i think this movie will be shallow for you but let's watch it

we want you to be so impressed by this that you let him go back to work.
okay i kind of hear you but only a little

karl do you want to go back to work? i do.

my priority is working.  my desires and feelings right now have been changing unexpectedly for a bit.

do you think we could get into _any_ part of your brain? do you think we could stop your heart?

i guess I believe so.  but it's possible that the mode you are using, and the way the brain responds, make
some things impossible.  (and notably I am not a neuroscientist and speak with no expertise here; just my
beliefs, guesses, and daydreams).  daydreams eh.  yes.

i guess i could come up

so, we can make you click here, when you're trying to click there
but we can't stop your heart.

they are different parts of the brain.

but i'm not certain of these things, just an idea

are you just having me review this to escalate me more?
i kind of want the officials to see it (as they hurt you); it could be meaningful for them
like, seriously
i just feel like it's a really bad idea to keep reviewing something like this
in the past it always goes horribly for me
okay i want them to see (how smart you are? yes. they will hurt you though.)
they already know this, it's why my brain is crippled; is this the wrong view somehow?
"why would we cripple your brain?"
okay having very little free will here
i've experienced belief that i have gotten stupider every year for about five (maybe 7) years
and it feels like unexpected inhibitions that slowly spread and develop through all the habits i consider intelligent

hmm if this actually _were_ a movie the impact would be really important

people respond to movies by being scared of stuff, or by thinking stuff is really cool

the movie should make it clear that such tech destroys life as we know it, and that
without some guidance would result in an incredibly dangerous, terrifying world where
people lose their minds while causing others to lose their minds, in order to survive

		wait why would that happen?      
	<i tihnk it is pretty @#% obvious why that would happen, and that it would happen,
         and the movie director would quickly realize it as he played the scenario out in his head.>
